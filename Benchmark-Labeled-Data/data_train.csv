That‚Äôs exactly what voters in North Carolina and Wisconsin will soon find out, after courts found multiple congressional and state legislative districts in North Carolina to be racial gerrymanders, and several state legislative districts in Wisconsin to be political ones. The rulings in essence mean North Carolina‚Äôs 2012 and 2014 congressional elections were conducted using unconstitutional districts though its 2016 elections were conducted under redrawn districts, the lines will need rethinking for 2018. And in both states, the rulings mean that the past three state legislative elections were partly unconstitutional, including ones held last month. Trump Could Be in Violation of the Constitution His First Day in Office, But these court decisions hardly mean the voting issues in these two states are settled. The complex legal and political fights over voting there have been ongoing over the past six years, and will continue. And those battles have consequences outside the state borders, too. Both states‚Äô cases could soon be argued in front of the Supreme Court, and have the potential to set precedent ahead of a partisan redefinition of electoral laws that appears likely nationwide over the next few years. The Court will consider a number of cases in these states that might reinterpret the Voting Rights Act, redefine gerrymandering, and change the way voting works. So what‚Äôs next? According to Michael Li, senior counsel for the Brennan Center‚Äôs Democracy Program, the court system essentially has all the authority to figure out what voting will look like in North Carolina and Wisconsin going forward. ‚ÄùThe court has broad power to construct a remedy when a map gets struck down for racial gerrymandering or failure to comply with the Voting Rights Act,‚Äù Li said. ‚ÄúOne of those remedies, of course, is drawing a new map or supervising the drawing of a new map. The court can ‚Äî although it doesn‚Äôt have to ‚Äî order new elections, but it has in the past. So for example, when a number of Texas districts were struck down in 2006, there were special elections in those districts for Congress. ‚Äù In North Carolina at least, a special election is part of the district court‚Äôs tentative solution to fix the racially gerrymandered districts for the state legislature. The same panel that in August declared 28 General Assembly districts unconstitutional ordered the state to redraw those areas last week, and to hold a special election during 2017‚Äôs cycle for the redrawn districts. That means state legislators elected last month will only serve a term. Though that‚Äôs only if the order stands: The North Carolina state government has already filed an appeal to the original August ruling to the U. S. Supreme Court, and the justices‚Äô decision could reverse the lower court‚Äôs order for a special election, and will have the last say on whether the original redistricting plan was in fact a racial gerrymander. The situation in Wisconsin is a bit more straightforward, but perhaps has more consequence nationally. On November 21, a federal district court struck down Wisconsin‚Äôs state legislative map on the grounds of partisan, rather than racial, gerrymandering, meaning that officials manipulated districts in a way that ‚Äúwill consistently degrade a voter‚Äôs or a group of voters‚Äô influence on the political process as a whole,‚Äù according to previous Court opinions. (Congressional districts are unaffected.) The case will likely be reviewed by the Supreme Court. That‚Äôs where its importance comes into play: So far in history, no district has ever been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on the grounds of partisan gerrymandering, though the Court does recognize that it can be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court docket over the next few years will probably be saturated with cases about state voting laws and districts, including those in North Carolina and Wisconsin, thanks to the Court‚Äôs 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision. That ruling weakened the federal government‚Äôs administrative oversight of elections laws over jurisdictions with a history of discrimination, and essentially made lawsuits the primary vehicle for remedying discrimination claims. The Supreme Court‚Äôs decision on Wisconsin‚Äôs partisan districts could further complicate matters in North Carolina, too ‚Äî specifically, for its U. S. House districts. Those districts were redrawn by Republican lawmakers before the 2016 election after a district court declared the lines unconstitutional on the grounds of racial gerrymandering. But the state Democratic Party is now suing to block the new maps as well: It alleges that the same officials who created the racially gerrymandered districts replaced them with unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. If the Supreme Court says that partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional in Wisconsin, that case will become powerful precedent in sorting out North Carolina‚Äôs congressional districts. If the Supreme Court finds Wisconsin‚Äôs and North Carolina‚Äôs state legislative districts unconstitutional, that would mean three consecutive state governments apiece enacted laws using unlawful districts. Perhaps most remarkably, those laws include voting measures recently passed by both states ‚Äî ones that themselves seem to have partisan, if not racial, animus. The North Carolina voting law was one of the most expansive in the country, and included strict voter ID measures and a rollback of early voting and registration, provisions that were found by a state review to benefit minority voters the most. Those same provisions were found unconstitutional by the Fourth Circuit court this year ‚Äî the 2016 election in the state was conducted under the previous voting laws ‚Äî and the Supreme Court will likely see a challenge to the Fourth Circuit‚Äôs decision in the next year as well. In Wisconsin, a less expansive voter ID law was declared constitutional this year but was in effect for the 2016 election. An appeal by the American Civil Liberties Union to block that law was denied before the election, but it will likely appear in courts again. These legal circumstances create a unique quandary for residents of North Carolina and Wisconsin, who may change districts multiple times in a few years, face conflicting reports of special elections, and may have had their ability to vote threatened by unconstitutional governments. Wisconsin Republicans may have gained power through unlawful partisan advantage, and then passed on that advantage via voting laws. And according to Li, if the Supreme Court upholds North Carolina‚Äôs state legislative districts as racial gerrymanders, that decision would mean that Republicans given an illegal edge based on racial discrimination passed laws to further that advantage. ‚ÄùNorth Carolina is in a bit of an unprecedented situation,‚Äù Li said. ‚ÄúAfter Republicans took control in 2010, they were very aggressive in maximizing their advantage, primarily by disadvantaging African Americans and other communities of color. The situation really is quite unprecedented because not only are the maps problematic, but you also have a number of restrictive voting laws in place. . .. I can‚Äôt think of another situation where you‚Äôve had this exact dynamic.‚Äù Overall, what‚Äôs next is a nightmare to predict. If either of the decisions on Wisconsin and North Carolina in this Court is deadlocked, the next Court with a Trump appointee as a ninth justice might side with the North Carolina and Wisconsin state legislatures on gerrymandering and on the states‚Äô voting laws. That would mean both the controversial maps and voting laws could continue to be used ‚Äî and that the 2016 North Carolina congressional elections were conducted under a court decision on voting rules that was later invalidated. If there is some delay in a Supreme Court pick, the establishment of precedent for voting laws and gerrymandering will likely be determined by which cases are deadlocked or not. For voters in North Carolina, any could mean there won‚Äôt even be time for a special election. ‚ÄùIt is really hard to figure out exactly how this will all play out,‚Äù Li said. ‚ÄúThere are any number of twists and turns that are still possible. It‚Äôs possible the Supreme Court could put a hold on the special election in North Carolina until we decide whether these districts were actually racial gerrymanders or not. It‚Äôs also possible that the timing just won‚Äôt work out. It‚Äôs possible that the legislature just might not draw maps that work.‚Äù The only certain thing, it appears, is that uncertainty will dominate in both states.","It‚Äôs easy to be critical of Obamacare for the mess it has made of the U. S. system and for expanding a Medicaid program that is simply not sustainable. But from the time the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed to the day a new president and Congress can change it in 2017, America‚Äôs governors haven‚Äôt had the luxury of just complaining about it. They have faced real people with real needs and real problems that need to be solved now, on the ground, not in some debating society or policy journal. What John Kasich and his team have accomplished by collaborating with key stakeholders in the Ohio system, and within the federal law and all of its regulations they had no ability to change, is impressive. Governor Kasich has called for repealing and replacing Obamacare, like all of the other Republican candidates. But before Republicans have any chance of doing that in 2017 at the federal level, Governor Kasich has made big policy change a reality in Ohio. The accomplishments of the Kasich administration do not end there. It has begun to make fundamental reforms in collaboration with the state‚Äôs providers and insurance companies to put Ohio‚Äôs system on a track to financial sustainability. Policymakers generally agree that to make our system affordable over the long term, we need to move away from the system, which pays for more encounters, and move to a system that pays for value ‚Äî for getting people healthy sooner. Since 2012, the Kasich administration has worked with consumer representatives, health plans, providers, and partners to collaboratively remake the payment system in Ohio one that pays for value ‚Äî a system that wastes less and gets people well sooner. In March 2015, as a result of the Kasich administration‚Äôs leadership, Ohio‚Äôs largest private plans began measuring and reporting the performance of providers for six episodes of care. A second set of episodes will be added in 2016, and still more will be measured statewide starting in 2017. Ohio is on track to reduce, by the end of 2018, the incentives for unnecessary care and to better reward the best care for more than 50 different health conditions touching 90 percent of Ohio patients. In 2015, the Kasich administration formed the Medical Home design team to hold down the cost of care by preventing disease and better managing chronic conditions in settings. The team worked with more than 800 Ohio stakeholders representing patients, providers, and health plans. The team created a new payment model that will financially reward practices that do a better job of preventing disease and managing chronic conditions. The new model will be implemented in both Ohio Medicaid and private health insurance starting in 2016 ‚Äî two years ahead of schedule. Under Ohio law, 50 percent of Ohio‚Äôs managed Medicaid payments must take advantage of these new systems by being by 2020. America‚Äôs costs are simply unsustainable. Employers are increasing the share of their workers‚Äô premiums at alarming rates while also increasing their deductibles and . Obamacare‚Äôs unaffordable premiums and deductibles for the middle class are legendary. Medicare and Medicaid are grabbing a bigger and bigger share of the federal budget and cannot continue in their present form. entitlements must be reformed, with cost containment being the top priority. The other Republican presidential candidates have been telling us they want to clear out the Obamacare mess, but John Kasich is the only candidate who has started the job. While the other candidates have been busy pointing out the lemons, John Kasich has been busy making lemonade, putting Ohio ahead of the curve for the day in 2017 when change at the federal level can begin.,","An American badger has been captured burying the carcass of a cow ‚Äî a previously unrecorded behaviour ‚Äî in an astonishing display of the creature‚Äôs digging prowess. The images were taken by camera traps set up by researchers who had left seven calf carcasses in Utah‚Äôs Grassy Mountains in January last year in an attempt to study which scavengers descended on the animals. ‚ÄúI was expecting we were going to get a lot of vultures and maybe some eagles and coyotes and different things,‚Äù said Evan Buechley, a doctoral candidate at the University of Utah and of the study. ‚ÄúBut then this badger stole the show. ‚Äù Buechley‚Äôs suspicions were aroused when, upon checking on the carcasses, he found one had completely disappeared. ‚ÄúThe ground was disturbed but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be buried,‚Äù said Buechley. ‚ÄúI was pretty bummed because it was a ton of work to drive these carcasses out into the desert. ‚Äù But examination of the pictures from the camera trap revealed an extraordinary turn of events. A badger completely buries the calf, with the animal setting to work almost immediately after its initial discovery of the carcass. Despite being a nocturnal creature, the images show it digging both during the day and at night. From the video created from the images, the badger can be seen digging around the calf until the dead bovine sinks into the dirt as the tunnels dug beneath it collapse. The badger then covers its cache with soil, before taking what appears to be a rest atop the mound, looking directly at the camera. ‚ÄúI was really shocked and amazed, and really excited,‚Äù said Buechley. When Buechley checked on the other carcasses, he found another calf had been almost completely buried, with only a leg sticking out where the carcass had been secured to the ground with a stake. But the images in the camera trap showed that calf had been buried by a different badger. ‚ÄúThe second one was really informative because it meant it wasn‚Äôt a freak behaviour,‚Äù said Buechley. According to the researchers the discovery, published in the journal the Western North American Naturalist, is the first time badgers have been reported burying a carcass several times bigger than themselves. While the calves weigh in around 23kg, female badgers weigh on average 6. 3kg and males 8. 6kg. The discovery, they add, suggests that badgers might be responsible for disposing of more animal carrion than previously thought ‚Äî potentially having effects on the food supply of other animals. ‚ÄúThe ground serves as a way to keep the carcass cool, so it inhibits decomposition, so [the badgers] can feed upon it and totally monopolise that really important food source,‚Äù said Buechley. Indeed, after completely burying the calf, the badger built a den next to it. ‚ÄúFor about two weeks it hung out underground,‚Äù said Buechley. ‚ÄúDown there it has got this awesome food source. ‚Äù Both badgers constructed dens alongside their cache, where they slept, fed, and spent up to 11 days continuously underground. They abandoned the sites 41 and 52 days after initial discovery.","The Chronicle of Higher Education sympathetically described what was ‚Äúsurely the worst day of [one University of Missouri journalism professor‚Äôs] professional life‚Äù ‚Äî November 9, 2015, when hundreds of outraged viewers emailed her after a viral video showed her calling for ‚Äúmuscle‚Äù against a student reporter attempting to cover protests on campus. But the Chronicle‚Äôs summary of Professor Melissa Click‚Äôs emails is grossly misleading. It neglects to mention how condemnation of Click‚Äôs behavior was not only understandable but appropriate. It highlights some of the most extreme emails she received as though they were the norm it describes as ‚Äúan assortment of angry First Amendment enthusiasts‚Äù the scores of current students, alumni, professional journalists, and parents who criticized Click‚Äôs call for violence against a student and it ignores the disturbing radicalism of her supporters. Rasmussen continued: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm OK ‚Äî I‚Äôd be fine if we brought back the guillotine and cut off the Koch brothers‚Äô heads. That would be OK with me. I think that would be OK. ‚Äù He added that protesters occupying public spaces should have the right to shut out the media because ‚Äúwith Occupy Wall Street, a lot of us lefties learned that if you give open access to the media, some people with an agenda will try to find people in your camp who will say ridiculous things and make it look like your whole group [supports those stances]. ‚Äù RELATED: Poor Melissa Click, She Received Some Mean The Chronicle did, however, quote in detail some of the ‚Äúthreats and horrorcore‚Äù sent to Click. ‚ÄúI plan to when someone shanks you or sets you on fire in the next week,‚Äù the article excerpts. ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre by some of the very animals with whom you‚Äôre so enamored,‚Äù another quoted by the Chronicle said. Click‚Äôs critics also frequently engaged in ‚Äúimpertinent ‚Äù and ‚Äú‚Äù the Chronicle describes dismissively. RELATED: The Pink Guards on Campus, But such emails were few and far between, National Review‚Äôs review of more than 1, 100 pages of emails, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, shows. Most of the correspondence condemned Click‚Äôs actions in a tone that was outraged but fairly civil. Current students, parents of students, alumni, journalists, and at least one donor appropriately expressed their disapproval, calling Click‚Äôs behavior ‚Äúshameful,‚Äù ‚Äúnot in the best interest of the university,‚Äù ‚Äúembarrassing,‚Äù and ‚Äúa blatant violation of [students‚Äô] First Amendment rights. ‚Äù Share article on FacebookshareTweet More than 150 calls for Click‚Äôs resignation poured in, and criticism spanned the globe. A Voice of America correspondent in Uganda said Click‚Äôs behavior may be helpful in ‚Äúpreparing students for what they will face from 3rd world African dictatorships. ‚Äù A photojournalist working in Hong Kong and Dubai wrote that Click had ‚Äúfailed as a professor of communication. ‚Äù Click even drew ire from some who sympathized with the protesters ‚Äî another fact the Chronicle never mentions. One Black Lives Matter activist wrote, ‚ÄúYour treatment of the press, especially in light of how respectful that reporter was and your field of study[,] was disgraceful. ‚Äù RELATED: Missouri‚Äôs Lesson: The Campus Wars Are About Power, Not Justice Another writer, who described himself as ‚Äúa political progressive, a refugee of Occupy Wall Street, a Black Lives Matter activist and strongly supportive of the student movement at Missouri‚Äù put it more bluntly to Click: ‚ÄúWhat the holy hell were you thinking?‚Äù he asked in italics, later calling for her resignation. Such an outcry against Click was admittedly harsh ‚Äî but, except for a few truly obscene or threatening emails, wholly merited. As many of the emails pointed out, there‚Äôs something exquisitely ironic and contemptible about a journalism professor seeking to silence the press, especially by violence. The fact that Click held a position of authority on campus, and that the reporters involved were students, makes her behavior all the more outrageous. Mark Schierbecker, 22, who filmed the viral video, described to National Review how, ‚Äúin that moment, my feelings were that my life, my was in jeopardy. ‚Äù He notes that the video also depicts protesters pushing another student journalist. Click‚Äôs supporters ‚Äúare falling all over themselves to somehow justify her actions,‚Äù Scheirbecker says. ‚ÄúEven the Communications Department has said that violence is never an acceptable form of communication ‚Äî so hearing [of support for Click] from professors around the nation scares me, because I‚Äôve maintained to this point that Melissa Click is a symptom of a much larger, more insidious problem at public universities ‚Äî and that is, it‚Äôs OK to resort to physical violence to combat emotional which don‚Äôt hurt anybody. ‚Äù The Chronicle also fails to mention how, in late December, 115 faculty members from the University of Missouri signed a letter to the administration in support of Click. These misguided professors call Click‚Äôs call for ‚Äúmuscle‚Äù a ‚Äúregrettable mistake‚Äù and ‚Äúcall upon the University to defend her first amendment rights of protest and her freedom to act as a private citizen,‚Äù but they express no dismay at the violated First Amendment rights of student reporters. They also say that ‚Äúwe believe that Click has been wronged in the media by those who have attacked her personally and have called for her dismissal,‚Äù failing to mention how the controversy began when Click wronged the media. More Higher Education Professor Laments Being Forced to Waste Time on Title IX ‚ÄòTraining‚ÄôWhy Keep Colleges from Being Responsible Lenders? MedsWhile Click stepped down from her position at the school of journalism, she continues to teach communications at the University of Missouri. Yet her position is far from secure. A Change. org petition calling for her to be fired has gained more than 3, 300 signatures one of the university‚Äôs curators has called for further disciplinary action, possibly including firing and more than 100 Republican state lawmakers penned an open letter calling for Click‚Äôs removal. A better Chronicle of Higher Education would note how Click, caught in an act of injustice, kept her job even as irate protesters forced far less culpable colleagues to resign. At very least, though, it should have accurately characterized her correspondents‚Äô complaints. ‚Äî Jillian Kay Melchior writes for National Review as a Thomas L.

55,content,3,42571,0,0,42550,99.9506706,0,0,0,0,"In preparation for the new Ghost in the Shell movie, I recently returned to the 1995 anime film on which it‚Äôs based, and I couldn‚Äôt help but think of two things: The Matrix, and philosopher Daniel Dennett. The link to The Matrix is obvious enough. Before making that movie, the Wachowskis showed Ghost in the Shell to producer Joel Silver as an example of what they wanted to accomplish with their action sequences. It‚Äôs not an adaptation, but The Matrix ended up borrowing heavily from both the structure and visuals of Ghost in the Shell. As for Dennett, the movie dwells on many of the same questions and ideas about the nature of consciousness with which Dennett, a philosopher and cognitive scientist at Tufts University, has spent the better part of his career engaging. As a recent New Yorker profile of Dennett notes, he believes that consciousness is ‚Äúsomething like the product of multiple, layered computer programs running on the hardware of the brain. ‚Äù It‚Äôs an evolutionary process, purely physical in nature, in which sensory information and other biological functions combine and grow correspondingly more complex over time. There‚Äôs no mystery ‚Äî just complexity. The anime Ghost in the Shell finishes with a protracted shootout against a giant robot tank that looks like a spider ‚Äî but the true climax is a lengthy monologue in which the villain, a sentient computer program, explains how he unexpectedly gained and laments the lack of basic life systems like death and reproduction. He finishes the speech by asking the movie‚Äôs protagonist, the cybernetically enhanced security officer Major Kusanagi, to merge with him, allowing for an evolutionary procreation. It‚Äôs a foray into both the emergence of the self and its evolutionary perpetuation. These are the sorts of questions that have animated the Ghost in the Shell franchise for more than two decades. The world of Ghost in the Shell is part futuristic action movie and part philosophy lecture, in which artfully constructed animated action sequences serve as vehicles for investigations into the nature of consciousness. It‚Äôs a showcase for what animation can do ‚Äî one that the new movie never quite manages to match. By positing a world in which people merge with machines, Ghost in the Shell examines what makes us fundamentally human The Ghost in the Shell franchise began as a Japanese manga series in the late 1980s, but it was the 1995 movie that built its international reputation. The film arrived at a time when anime was gaining global reach, and it highlighted the form‚Äôs strengths: richly detailed art, world building, stunningly executed action sequences, and a willingness to deal in both adult themes and content. For many, including me, Ghost in the Shell was a gateway to the wider world of Japanese animation, one that blended the appeal of comic books, movies, and science fiction ‚Äî in particular, the sort of cyberpunk that Western writers like William Gibson had popularized in the 1980s. The film introduced the characters and ideas that would become the foundation for the franchise. Those characters included the franchise‚Äôs protagonist, Major Kusanagi, a hybrid whose construction is shown during the film‚Äôs opening credits, and her colleagues Batou, a gruff, tough cyborg with enhanced eyes and a shock of white hair, and Togusa, a newbie officer who is probably the closest thing the movie offers to an audience surrogate. They all work for Section 9, a shadowy government security agency run by the aging Chief Aramaki, another character who would recur throughout the series. The story follows Section 9‚Äôs pursuit of a mysterious hacker known as the Puppet Master who, in a world of individuals, can hack humans as well as machines. Director Mamoru Oshii wanted a movie that portrayed the ‚Äúinfluence and power of computers‚Äù by looking at how that influence and power might evolve over time, and the film posits a near future in which humans have begun to merge with machines. Limbs are upgraded with weaponry and other special functions; eyes are replaced with powerful sensors; minds and memories are expanded via external storage technology. The inevitable question that arises from all this, of course, is how much artificial enhancement and replacement can a person undergo and still remain fundamentally human? That‚Äôs where the concept of the ‚Äúghost‚Äù comes in. A ghost is a person‚Äôs deep self, his or her essence, which remains intact even as one‚Äôs physical body becomes more and more integrated with computers and machines. The name is a reference to philosopher Arthur Koestler‚Äôs 1967 book The Ghost in the Machine, a treatise on the nature of consciousness whose title was borrowed from another philosopher, Gilbert Ryle, who coined the phrase to describe the notion of consciousness as somehow apart and separate from biological processes. Koestler‚Äôs book took up the notion that humanity‚Äôs existence might have been a mistake, an evolutionary error, and dealt with humanity‚Äôs propensity to violence and awareness of the inevitability of death ‚Äî all ideas that would come into play, in various ways, throughout Ghost in the Shell‚Äôs story. This thematic richness would come to define the franchise ‚Äî and occasionally weigh it down, especially under Oshii. His 2004 sequel, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, is, in theory, another in which Batou and Togusa, now partners, investigate a series of murders involving robotic geishas that have been implanted with humanlike artificial intelligence. If anything, the Ghost in the Shell sequel is even more densely packed with philosophical references than the original: The film‚Äôs questioning, ponderous dialogue French philosopher Ren√© Descartes and John Milton, among others, and includes scenes in which robot replicas of the two detectives spout lines like, ‚ÄúThe 15th century theory has been resurrected by cyberbrains. ‚Äù In an action scene near the end, the script winks at its own proclivities when Batou, facing an army of killer grumbles, ‚ÄúLook, this ain‚Äôt the time to get philosophical ‚Äî I‚Äôm running low on ammo here. ‚Äù In the world of Ghost in the Shell, though, it‚Äôs always time to get philosophical. The sprawling Ghost in the Shell franchise is linked by a commitment to science fiction world building and philosophical inquiry It‚Äôs not necessary to catch every academic reference to enjoy the Ghost in the Shell series. The action sequences are reliably inventive and thrillingly staged, with blocking that is better choreographed than many films. The animation by Production IG, one of Japan‚Äôs most accomplished animation houses (if you‚Äôve seen the animated sequence from Kill Bill, you‚Äôve seen their work) is consistently stunning, particularly in the way it blends environmental details. New Port City, the fictional Asian city where the series is set, is based partially on Hong Kong, and with its mix of grime and tech, modern and busy street markets, it has the feel of a real place. It‚Äôs an aging metropolis built up in layers, over time, the urban counterpart to Dennett‚Äôs theory of consciousness. The technology, too, is intricate and fascinating: Robotically enhanced bodies expand and reshape themselves, revealing fingers made for typing and eyes that jack into digital sensor arrays. The design work is busy and functional, almost industrial at times, as if designed for use rather than stylishness. Watching the series today, some of the choices can come across as a bit strange, in particular the reliance on bundles of wires for connectivity. But that‚Äôs part of the series‚Äô charm: Even in more recent incarnations, it‚Äôs a vision of a future that is, in some sense, a perpetual extension of the technology of 1995. Those later incarnations include the TV series Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, which ran for two seasons starting in 2002. Written and directed by Kenji Kamiyama, the show was an extension of the first film that also featured the Major, Batou, Togusa, and Aramaki. Although it was more of a traditional action procedural than the film that inspired it, it nonetheless dealt in similar concepts and questions about computer networks, identity, consciousness, and reality. The first season sent the team on the trail of another mysterious hacker, the Laughing Man, while the second pitted them against a terrorist group called the Individual Eleven, which spread a virus through the posting of a fake terrorist manifesto. (Both seasons were also recut and into movies titled The Laughing Man and Individual Eleven, respectively, that focused more narrowly on the plot arcs.) More recently, the franchise has been essentially rebooted in a series dubbed Ghost in the Shell: Arise, a sequence of five original video animations (essentially mini movies) that were later recut into a TV series, and which connected with the 2015 film Ghost in the Shell: The New Movie. Arise takes place in an alternate continuity but has many of the same elements as the rest of the franchise, including the main cast of characters (albeit with new designs) and animation by Production IG. What links all the various iterations is a commitment to science fiction world building and philosophical inquiry. At every turn, the series offers a reminder that animation can do more than comedy and kid stuff ‚Äî the realm in which it is most often found in the United States ‚Äî and that at its best, it‚Äôs also capable of ideas and action, drama and intellectual engagement, imagery and stories to match. Sadly, the reboot doesn‚Äôt live up to its animated predecessors. Sure, it‚Äôs a visual marvel, often faithfully replicating key scenes and images from the original film, and sure, there‚Äôs still a lot of talk about ghosts and souls and what it means to be a human. But the characters themselves are all empty husks ‚Äî there‚Äôs not a single identifiable personality in the film ‚Äî and both the visuals and the dialogue lack the deeper context of the original. The search for the idea of a soul has been streamlined and Westernized into a simple quest for individual identity and memory. The result is a movie that‚Äôs all borrowed parts, with no depth or connection. The layers never quite come together to form something more. It wants to be a movie about the search for consciousness, but, unlike its source material, it doesn‚Äôt have a soul.","CHARLOTTE ‚Äî President Obama made his debut on the campaign trail Tuesday for Hillary Clinton, declaring himself ‚Äúready to pass the baton‚Äù during a boisterous rally in this battleground state on a politically challenging day for his preferred successor. ‚ÄúMy faith in Hillary Clinton has always been rewarded,‚Äù Obama told an overflow crowd of thousands at the Charlotte Convention Center, where he heaped praise on his former secretary of state as she perched on the edge of a chair a few feet away. Neither the president, nor Clinton, nor any of the other speakers on the program here made a single mention of the campaign news that dominated the day: the announcement by FBI Director James B. Comey that his agency will not recommend criminal charges against Clinton for her use of a private email server but that it found her staff ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù in handling sensitive material. [FBI recommends no criminal charges in Clinton email probe] Obama instead recounted his growing confidence in Clinton‚Äôs abilities from the time they were Democratic primary rivals to her tenure as secretary of state to her newfound status as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee against Republican Donald Trump. ‚ÄúThere has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office than her. Ever. And that‚Äôs the truth,‚Äù said Obama, who appeared sans suit jacket and with the sleeves of his dress shirt rolled up. He said that when confronted with adversity, Clinton has a tendency to ‚Äústand up straighter and come back stronger. ‚Äù The pair traveled together aboard Air Force One to North Carolina, a state that has preferred Republican presidents but where Clinton sees a real opportunity this year against Trump. Obama prevailed in the Tar Heel State in 2008 against John McCain only to lose it four years later to Mitt Romney. North Carolina has been won by Republicans in eight of the last 10 cycles. Underscoring the importance of the state to his campaign, Trump was countering with a rally in Raleigh, about 150 miles away, on Tuesday night. As Clinton‚Äôs event wrapped up here, several hundred people were lined up in heat for Trump‚Äôs rally, which was set to begin at 7 p. m. in a downtown performing arts center. Two of the state‚Äôs most prominent Republicans Gov. Pat McCrory and Sen. Richard Burr both declined to attend the Tuesday evening rally with Trump, citing other obligations to the local media. The presumptive Republican nominee is expected to be joined by Sen. Bob Corker ( .) believed to be under consideration as a Trump running mate. Clinton, whose event was attended by Democratic members of Congress and the party‚Äôs nominee for governor, spoke ahead of Obama, making several references to their former status as rivals. As they came out on stage together, Obama smiled broadly, and appearing relaxed, pumped his fist and helped lead chants of ‚ÄúHillary, Hillary, Hillary. ‚Äù The two embraced after Clinton‚Äôs remarks. In a statement last week, Trump predicted he would ‚Äúdo great‚Äù in North Carolina. ‚ÄúPeople of North Carolina want strength, protection and jobs, and President Obama and Hillary Clinton have let them down for many years,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI will bring jobs back to North Carolina, and our country, like never seen before. ‚Äù There has been limited independent polling in the state, but what‚Äôs available suggests a competitive contest. One survey released last week by the conservative Civitas Institute put Clinton at 42 percent and Trump at 40 percent, with Libertarian Gary Johnson at 6 percent. A poll last week by the Democratic firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research found a wider margin, with Clinton leading Trump, 48 percent to 38 percent, and Johnson at 8 percent. Part of Obama‚Äôs aim in North Carolina, aides say, will be to bolster Clinton‚Äôs standing among voters and African Americans, as well as among younger voters, who were part of his winning coalition but sided in large numbers during the primaries with Clinton‚Äôs rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. [Clinton and Trump are about to draw the battle lines in their fight for North Carolina] As Obama begins to campaign in earnest for Clinton, aides said, he will not just make the case for why she is best poised to succeed him. The president will also raise money to help fill her campaign coffers and encourage key constituency groups to register to vote in time. Inside the convention center, enthusiasm for Clinton didn‚Äôt seemed to have been dampened by the morning‚Äôs news on the email investigation. Mary Beth Ferrell, a public high school teacher, who traveled more than an hour from was watching the landing of Air Force One on her phone as she waited for Obama and Clinton to make their way to the rally. ‚ÄúI just think it‚Äôs time to move beyond this,‚Äù Farrell, 54, said about the email issue, though she acknowledged Republicans weren‚Äôt likely to do that. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all they‚Äôve got. They don‚Äôt have a candidate. ‚Äù Deborah Wellington, who worked in computer networking before she retired, said she was peeved by the three hours she had to wait to get into the rally but wasn‚Äôt bothered by Clinton‚Äôs email practices. ‚ÄúI understand email security,‚Äù said Wellington, 64, a Charlotte resident. ‚ÄúThere should have been somebody else monitoring this. She‚Äôs got people for that. ‚Äù Juliet Eilperin and Jenna Johnson contributed to this story. Save Save","This year marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Beatrix Potter, one of the most enduring and cherished children‚Äôs authors of all time. To commemorate the anniversary, a new, story by Potter, called The Tale of Kitty in Boots, has been released. Readers, we‚Äôve been down this road before, not too long ago, and it didn‚Äôt end well. Atticus Finch‚Äôs reputation took a hit after his exposure in Harper Lee‚Äôs Go Set A Watchman as a segregationist and reactionary extremist. Do we really want to risk losing cherished illusions about the likes of Squirrel Nutkin and Jemima in exchange for the novelty of a freshly unearthed tale by Beatrix Potter? Oh, but it‚Äôs already too late for this question. As many of us learned in Potter‚Äôs most famous story, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, once the garden of unknown delights beckons, it‚Äôs all but impossible to resist entering in. Here‚Äôs the backstory to this ‚Äùnew‚Äù Beatrix Potter book: Two years ago, a woman named Jo Hanks who‚Äôs an editor at Penguin Random House in the United Kingdom came upon a reference to a letter that Potter wrote in 1914. In that letter, Potter mentioned working on the manuscript of a story about ‚Äùa prime black Kitty cat who leads a rather double life.‚Äù Hanks dug into Potter‚Äôs archives at The Victoria Albert Museum and she found the manuscript of The Tale of . Potter had written three drafts of the story and had done one watercolor illustration of Kitty, but for various reasons, she died in 1943 without completing the book. Skip to the present and this lavish debut edition of The Tale of . To use an antiquated phrase that Potter herself would have known, this edition is ‚Äùdone up brown.‚Äù Quentin Blake, best known for his work on Roald Dahl‚Äôs books, has created the illustrations and, on an audio CD included with the book, Helen Mirren reads the story. Ironically, such glitzy trappings make for a disconcerting Potter reading experience. After all, the charm of Potter‚Äôs tales emanates, in part, from their humility ‚Äî the signature compactness of her books and animal characters. Add to that, the fact that Blake‚Äôs style as an illustrator is jittery and impressionistic, in contrast to Potter‚Äôs fluid precision. His illustrations end up emphasizing, rather than countering, the violence that lurks in even the most amiable Potter tale. That ominous tone is set in the very first story when Peter Rabbit‚Äôs mother gives him and his sisters ‚Äî Flopsy, Mopsy and ‚Äî a warning: ‚ÄùNow, my dears,‚Äù said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, ‚Äùyou may go into the fields or down the lane, but don‚Äôt go into Mr. McGregor‚Äôs garden: your Father had an accident there he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.‚Äù In its own quaint way, Potter‚Äôs landscape is every bit as Gothic as the Brontes‚Äô. And, sometimes, as in The Tale of Potter‚Äôs stories are nearly as surreal as Lewis Carroll‚Äôs. The ‚ÄùKitty‚Äù in question here calls herself ‚ÄùMiss Catherine St. Quintin,‚Äù and she does, indeed, lead a double life. By day she‚Äôs the docile pet of a kind old lady by night she‚Äôs a poacher who prowls the countryside armed with an and dressed in ‚Äùa gentleman‚Äôs Norfolk jacket, and little boots.‚Äù Kitty is such a convincing gender nonconformist that she‚Äôs mistaken for ‚Äùa sportsman‚Äù by Mrs. the from an earlier tale. Other recognizable furry faces include fellow feline Tabitha Twitchit, Mr. Tod the creepy fox and a much older Peter Rabbit, described as ‚Äùstout‚Äù and ‚Äùvery fat.‚Äù Rest assured, this is the closest we come here to that dread Atticus Finch moment in which a beloved character is changed for the worse. Newly discovered manuscripts by revered authors hold out the promise of familiar, yet fresh, literary magic in truth, though, The Tale of is just a curious afterword to the 24 children‚Äôs books Potter completed in her lifetime. Perhaps the best thing about this ‚Äùnew‚Äù story is that it will send some readers back to the originals and to the life of the extraordinary woman who wrote them. Potter was a naturalist, fascinated by fungi she was a shrewd businesswoman, who patented an early ‚ÄùPeter Rabbit‚Äù doll and other merchandise and she was an environmentalist, responsible for the preservation of much of The Lake District in England. Potter‚Äôs tales sprang from her deep appreciation of all creatures slight and small, but ‚Äî as a woman and a writer ‚Äî she was a smart, tough cookie certainly no Mrs. .","Nearly simultaneously with President Trump‚Äôs oath of office Friday, the White House website shifted to remove climate change related content from the Obama administration and supplant it with a new statement of Trump‚Äôs energy policy ‚Äî one focused, it said, reducing ‚Äúburdensome regulations on our energy industry. ‚Äù Those are just words ‚Äî but an action hours later by White House chief of staff Reince Priebus had more teeth. Priebus‚Äôs memorandum, issuing a governmentwide freeze on new or pending regulations, would appear to have the effect of sweeping up four very nearly finished Energy Department energy efficiency standards, affecting an array of products, including portable air conditioners and commercial boilers. The standards are designed to reduce energy use, and, in the process, consumer bills and greenhouse gas emissions. The Priebus memo states that federal agencies cannot send new regulations to the Office of the Federal Register ‚Äî a key step in the finalization of new rules ‚Äî until Trump‚Äôs administration has leaders in place to approve what these agencies are doing. Moreover, it also states that regulations that have been sent to the office but have not yet made it into the published register need to be withdrawn. The Obama administration issued a similar memorandum right after the president took office in 2009. [On White House website, Obama climate priorities vanish, replaced by Trump‚Äôs focus on energy production] In this case, the language would appear to snag four energy efficiency regulations released very late in the Obama administration that, because of recently issued departmental rules designed to prevent errors, could not be published to the Federal Register for 45 days after their posting by the agency ‚Äî a timeline that pushed their finalization past the end of the Obama administration. The Obama administration, in part driven by ambitions to fight climate change, had been issuing a slew of energy efficiency standards, or regulations, each of which took a small bite out of the country‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions by requiring a line of products to use less energy. The regulations that would go into limbo affect portable air conditioners, coolers and freezers, commercial boilers and uninterruptible power supplies. According to analyses by Appliance Standards Awareness Project, which tracks these standards, over the long term these regulations would save consumers billions of dollars in energy costs by requiring manufacturers to make these products more efficient. The Priebus memorandum does not necessarily ensure the regulations‚Äô ultimate demise ‚Äî it merely halts them for further review. ‚ÄúThese four new standards assure consumers of these products a basic level of energy efficiency performance, so we hope that Perry, once confirmed, will swiftly approve them for publication,‚Äù said Andrew deLaski, director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. ‚ÄúThese standards should not be controversial,‚Äù he added. But even if some of the standards do ultimately go into effect, others may not ‚Äî or at least, not in the same form. That‚Äôs especially likely if they‚Äôre controversial or contested by industry, as at least one of them is. The memo ‚Äúis good news in the case of the commercial boiler rule, which we have many concerns about and which was not done through the negotiated rulemaking process,‚Äù said Francis Dietz, vice president for public affairs at the Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute. ‚ÄúWe would be seeking significant changes if and when that rule is redeveloped,‚Äù he said. Dietz and deLaski both agreed that the Priebus memorandum seems to put a hold on the four aforementioned energy efficiency rules, even though they are substantially finished and were merely held back so that interested parties could scan their texts for possible mistakes, including typos. These four regulations are among the most vulnerable Obama administration offerings, precisely because of the waiting period they were subject to before finalization. Other Trump rollback targets in the energy and environment space, like of Barack Obama‚Äôs Clean Power Plan, will be harder to take apart. But this wrinkle, however technocratic, nonetheless shows clearly that a new government has arrived.

Jerry Brown signed a sweeping package of tobacco bills into California law on Wednesday, including one that will raise the legal age to buy products from 18 to 21 and another that dramatically tightens restrictions on . But the governor vetoed a bill that would have permitted cities and counties to establish their own tobacco taxes. ‚ÄùAlthough California has one of the lowest cigarette taxes in the nation,‚Äù the governor said in a veto message, ‚ÄùI am reluctant to approve this measure in view of all the taxes being proposed for the 2016 ballot.‚Äù California becomes just the second state after Hawaii to raise the lawful age to buy tobacco products, a move that backers applaud as a certain way to curtail harm to adolescents, and reduce the number of adult smokers. State Sen. Ed Hernandez, a Democrat from West Covina, was the lead author of the bill to raise the tobacco age, and says he‚Äôs ‚Äùecstatic.‚Äù ‚ÄùWhat this means for California is now we can know that our youth are less likely to be addicted to this horrible drug of tobacco,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄùThere‚Äôs going to be less addiction to tobacco, [and] we‚Äôre going to reduce health care costs and save lives.‚Äù The law, which will take effect June 9, applies to all 18 to except military personnel. The bill had stalled for months until a compromise was reached to permit service members under 21 to continue purchasing tobacco. A major Institute of Medicine report last year concluded that if all states raised the tobacco age to 21, there would be a 12 percent drop in the number of teen and young adult smokers. ‚ÄùThe biggest drops in tobacco use (will) likely occur among teens ages 15 to 17 ‚Äî kids who can‚Äôt legally buy tobacco products in California now but who run in the same social circles as who may illegally purchase tobacco products for younger friends,‚Äù said Larry Cohen, executive director of the Prevention Institute, in Oakland, Calif. and a longtime advocate for tobacco control policies. Adolescents are at particular risk for nicotine addiction because their brains are still developing, says longtime tobacco critic, Stanton Glantz, director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco. ‚ÄùExposing the developing brain to nicotine, which is in both and conventional cigarettes, physically changes the brain,‚Äù Glantz says. ‚ÄùThat‚Äôs why the younger someone starts to smoke, the more addicted they tend to get . .. and the harder time they have stopping. Vaping Banned In Many Public Places, But the new regulations on may be even more significant, Glantz says. ‚ÄùThere‚Äôs no question that aren‚Äôt as dangerous as cigarettes are,‚Äù he says, ‚Äùbut they‚Äôre still dangerous.‚Äù Under the law, written by state Sen. Mark Leno, a Democrat from San Francisco, will be banned in all the same places that traditional cigarettes are ‚Äî workplaces, schools, restaurants, hospitals and more. And like other tobacco products, users will need to be 21 to buy . ‚ÄùThe is nothing more than a new delivery system for toxic and addictive nicotine,‚Äù Leno said in a written statement. ‚ÄùEnsuring that fall under California‚Äôs comprehensive laws is critical to protecting public health, especially given the alarming rate at which young people are picking up these devices.‚Äù A study last year from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that use among middle and high school students tripled from 2013 to 2014. Brown signed three other bills: groups are now focusing their efforts on an effort to gather signatures for a November ballot initiative that would raise cigarette taxes from the current $0. 87 per pack to $2. While California is seen as tough on tobacco, it ranks 36th in the country on taxes. A 2012 ballot initiative to raise taxes by $1 per pack failed by less than half a percentage point after the tobacco industry spent $47 million to defeat it. A statewide Field poll last year found that of California voters support an increase in tobacco taxes. This story was produced by KQED‚Äôs State of Health blog."

60,transcript,3,2467,0,0,2464,99.8783948,0,0,0,0,"I became an inventor by accident. I was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true: I went in in 1956, came out in 1959, was working at the University of Washington, and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article, for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm. Now, that was before cassette tapes, C.D.s, DVDs ‚Äî any of the cool stuff we've got now. And it was an arm that, instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record, went straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm. And it was the hardest invention I ever made, but it got me started, and I got really lucky after that.And without giving you too much of a tirade, I want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today: my 44th invention. No, that's not true either. Golly, I'm just totally losing it. My 44th patent; about the 15th invention. I call this hypersonic sound. I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes, but I want to make an analogy before I do to this. I usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say, That's really cool, but what's it good for? And I say, What is the light bulb good for? Sound, light: I'm going to draw the analogy. When Edison invented the light bulb, pretty much looked like this. Hasn't changed that much. Light came out of it in every direction. Before the light bulb was invented, people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it, focus it a little bit; put lenses in front of it, focus it a little bit better. Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers that were totally focused.Now, think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb, but you couldn't focus light; if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to. That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are. You turn on the loudspeaker, and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets, the sound just kind of goes where it wants. Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone, it's pretty much every direction. A little bit of differential, but not much. If the light bulb was the way the speaker is, and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it, we wouldn't have that, or movies in general, or computers, or T.V. sets, or C.D.s, or DVDs ‚Äî and just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light.Now, after almost 80 years of having sound, I thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to. I have a couple of units. That guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car ‚Äî small version, over your head ‚Äî so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car. What if I could aim sound the way I aim light?I got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard. Now, you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you. Maybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room. (Applause) The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool? (Applause) Because I have some limited time, I'll cut it off for a second, and tell you about how it works and what it's good for.Course, like light, it's great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack, or the cornflakes, or the toothpaste, or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby. Sony's got an idea ‚Äî Sony's our biggest customers right now. They tried this back in the '60s and were too smart, and so they gave up. But they want to use it ‚Äî seriously. There's a mix an inventor has to have. You have to be kind of smart, and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid, because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today. Too many other smart people out there. So. I just happened to get my education in a little different way. I'm not at all against education. I think it's wonderful; I think sometimes people, when they get educated, lose it: they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than. And we're living in a great time right now, because almost everything's being explored anew. I have this little slogan that I use a lot, which is: virtually nothing ‚Äî and I mean this honestly ‚Äî has been invented yet. We're just starting. We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics. And this is, I hope, a little piece of it.Sony's got this vision back ‚Äî to get myself on track ‚Äî that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket, you're going to watch a new T.V. channel. They know that when you watch T.V. at home, because there are so many choices you can change channels, miss their commercials. A hundred and fifty-one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket. Now, they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed, because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every 20 minutes, and reaches out, turns off the sound. And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made. For instance, like, when you're on an airplane, they show the movie, you get to watch it for free; when you want to hear the sound, you pay. And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket ‚Äî initially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways; they're trying this in three parts of the country right now ‚Äî you'll be watching TV.And hopefully they'll be sensitive that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet. But what's great about it, from the tests that have been done, is, if you don't want to hear it, you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it. So, we create silence as much as we create sound. ATMs that talk to you; nobody else hears it. Sit in bed, two in the morning, watch TV; your spouse, or someone, is next to you, asleep; doesn't hear it, doesn't wake up. We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring, noise from automobiles.I have been really lucky with this technology: all of a sudden as it is ready, the world is ready to accept it. They have literally beat a path to our door. We've been selling it since about last September, October, and it's been immensely gratifying. If you're interested in what it costs ‚Äî I'm not selling them today ‚Äî but this unit, with the electronics and everything, if you buy one, is around a thousand bucks. We expect by this time next year, it'll be hundreds, a few hundred bucks, to buy it. It's not any more pricey than regular electronics.Now, when I played it for you, you didn't hear the thunderous bass. This unit that I played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing. It's actually emitting ultrasound ‚Äî low-level ultrasound ‚Äî that's about 100,000 vibrations per second. And the sound that you're hearing, unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face, is made out in front of it, in the air. The air is not linear, as we've always been taught. You turn up the volume just a little bit ‚Äî I'm talking about a little over 80 decibels ‚Äî and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate. Here's why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow. It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure.Now, imagine, if you will, without getting too technical, I'm making a little sine wave here in the air. Well, if I turn up the amplitude too much, I'm having an effect on the pressure, which means during the making of that sine wave, the speed at which it is propagating is shifting. All of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear. Linearity means higher quality sound. Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite: it's 100 percent based on non-linearity. An effect happens in the air, it's a corrupting effect of the sound ‚Äî the ultrasound in this case ‚Äî that's emitted, but it's so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect.Now, the question is, where's the sound made? Instead of being made on the face of the cone, it's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air, and so when I aim it towards you, what you hear is made right next to your ears. I said we can shorten the column, we can spread it out to cover the couch. I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker, the other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound. When you listen to stereo on your home system, your both ears hear both speakers. Turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear. So, the stage is more restricted ‚Äî the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you. Because the sound is made in the air along this column, it does not follow the inverse square law, which says it drops off about two thirds every time you double the distance: 6dB every time you go from one meter, for instance, to two meters. That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony, and the guy in the front row gets the same level as the guy in the back row, now, all of a sudden. Isn't that terrific?So, we've been, as I say, very successful, very lucky, in having companies catch the vision of this, from cars ‚Äî car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids, and a separate system in the back ‚Äî oh, no, the kids aren't driving today. (Laughter) I was seeing if you were listening. Actually, I haven't had breakfast yet. A stereo system in the front for mom and dad, and maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids, and the parents don't want to be bothered with that, or their rap music or whatever. So, again, this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on. It also works for transmitting and communicating data. It also works five times better underwater.We've got the military ‚Äî have just deployed some of these into Iraq, where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside. (Laughter) Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse. (Laughter) I'm serious. And they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance, and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift from 100 yards away when they play this thing. And so, another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't. We make a version with this which puts out 155 decibels. Pain is 120. So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people, and there can be a public beach just off to the side, and they don't even know it's turned on. We sell those to the military presently for about 70,000 dollars, and they're buying them as fast as we can make them. We put it on a turret with a camera, so that when they shoot at you, you're over there, and it's there.I have a bunch of other inventions. I invented a plasma antenna, to shift gears. Looked up at the ceiling of my office one day ‚Äî I was working on a ground-penetrating radar project ‚Äî and my physicist CEO came in and said, ""We have a real problem. We're using very short wavelengths. We've got a problem with the antenna ringing. When you run very short wavelengths, like a tuning fork the antenna resonates, and there's more energy coming out of the antenna than there is the backscatter from the ground that we're trying to analyze, taking too much processing."" I says, ""Why don't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it? Turn it on; turn it off. That's a fluorescent tube refined."" I just sold that for a million and a half dollars, cash. I took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified, when the patent issued, and told the people back there about it, and they laughed, and then I took them back a demo and they bought. (Laughter)Any of you ever wore a Jabber headphone ‚Äî the little cell headphones? That's my invention. I sold that for seven million dollars. Big mistake: it just sold for 80 million dollars two years ago. I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer in my attic at my house, and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design I drew way back when.So, I've been really lucky as an inventor. I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet. And my dad died before he realized anybody in the family would maybe, hopefully, make something out of themselves. You've been a great audience. I know I've jumped all over the place. I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group.Let me give you, in the last minute, one more quick demo of this guy, for those of you that haven't heard it. Can never tell if it's on. If you haven't heard it, raise your hand. Getting it over there? Get the cameraman. Yeah, there you go. I've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head; that's really cool. Thank you once again. Appreciate it very much.","I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change. And I think it starts with one physician, and that's me. And maybe I've been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that. Before I actually begin the meat of my talk, let's begin with a bit of baseball. Hey, why not? We're near the end, we're getting close to the World Series. We all love baseball, don't we? (Laughter) Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics. And there's hundreds of them. ""Moneyball"" is about to come out, and it's all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team. I'm going to focus on one stat that I hope a lot of you have heard of. It's called batting average. So we talk about a 300, a batter who bats 300. That means that ballplayer batted safely, hit safely three times out of 10 at bats. That means hit the ball into the outfield, it dropped, it didn't get caught, and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn't get there in time and the runner was safe. Three times out of 10. Do you know what they call a 300 hitter in Major League Baseball? Good, really good, maybe an all-star. Do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter? That's somebody who hit, by the way, four times safely out of every 10. Legendary ‚Äî as in Ted Williams legendary ‚Äî the last Major League Baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season. Now let's take this back into my world of medicine where I'm a lot more comfortable, or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I'm going to talk to you about. Suppose you have appendicitis and you're referred to a surgeon who's batting 400 on appendectomies. (Laughter) Somehow this isn't working out, is it? Now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who's batting 200 on angioplasties. But, but, you know what? She's doing a lot better this year. She's on the comeback trail. And she's hitting a 257. Somehow this isn't working. But I'm going to ask you a question. What do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon, an OBGYN, a paramedic is supposed to be? 1,000, very good. Now truth of the matter is, nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat. What we do though is we send each one of them, including myself, out into the world with the admonition, be perfect. Never ever, ever make a mistake, but you worry about the details, about how that's going to happen. And that was the message that I absorbed when I was in med school. I was an obsessive compulsive student. In high school, a classmate once said that Brian Goldman would study for a blood test. (Laughter) And so I did. And I studied in my little garret at the nurses' residence at Toronto General Hospital, not far from here. And I memorized everything. I memorized in my anatomy class the origins and exertions of every muscle, every branch of every artery that came off the aorta, differential diagnoses obscure and common. I even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis. And all the while, I was amassing more and more knowledge. And I did well, I graduated with honors, cum laude. And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memorized everything and knew everything, or as much as possible, as close to everything as possible, that it would immunize me against making mistakes. And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. Drucker. I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto when Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where I was working. At the time I was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation. And it was my job, when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult, to see that patient in emerg. and to report back to my attending. And I saw Mrs. Drucker, and she was breathless. And when I listened to her, she was making a wheezy sound. And when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope, I could hear crackly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure. This is a condition in which the heart fails, and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward, some of the blood backs up into the lung, the lungs fill up with blood, and that's why you have shortness of breath. And that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make. I made it and I set to work treating her. I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart. I gave her medications that we call diuretics, water pills, to get her to pee out the access fluid. And over the course of the next hour and a half or two, she started to feel better. And I felt really good. And that's when I made my first mistake; I sent her home. Actually, I made two more mistakes. I sent her home without speaking to my attending. I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do, which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself. And he knew her, he would have been able to furnish additional information about her. Maybe I did it for a good reason. Maybe I didn't want to be a high-maintenance resident. Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attending's patients without even having to contact him. The second mistake that I made was worse. In sending her home, I disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me, ""Goldman, not a good idea. Don't do this."" In fact, so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker, ""Do you think it's okay if she goes home?"" And the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly, ""Yeah, I think she'll do okay."" I can remember that like it was yesterday. So I signed the discharge papers, and an ambulance came, paramedics came to take her home. And I went back to my work on the wards. All the rest of that day, that afternoon, I had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach. But I carried on with my work. And at the end of the day, I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don't usually do. I walked through the emergency department on my way home. And it was there that another nurse, not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse, said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians I know dread. Others in medicine dread them as well, but there's something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly. The three words are: Do you remember? ""Do you remember that patient you sent home?"" the other nurse asked matter-of-factly. ""Well she's back,"" in just that tone of voice. Well she was back all right. She was back and near death. About an hour after she had arrived home, after I'd sent her home, she collapsed and her family called 911 and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50, which is in severe shock. And she was barely breathing and she was blue. And the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops. They gave her medications to raise her blood pressure. They put her on a ventilator. And I was shocked and shaken to the core. And I went through this roller coaster, because after they stabilized her, she went to the intensive care unit, and I hoped against hope that she would recover. And over the next two or three days, it was clear that she was never going to wake up. She had irreversible brain damage. And the family gathered. And over the course of the next eight or nine days, they resigned themselves to what was happening. And at about the nine day mark, they let her go ‚Äî Mrs. Drucker, a wife, a mother and a grandmother. They say you never forget the names of those who die. And that was my first time to be acquainted with that. Over the next few weeks, I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine ‚Äî where I felt alone, isolated, not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel, because you can't talk about it with your colleagues. You know that healthy kind, when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions, but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say, I'll never make that mistake again. And you make amends and you never make that mistake again. That's the kind of shame that is a teacher. The unhealthy shame I'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside. It's the one that says, not that what you did was bad, but that you are bad. And it was what I was feeling. And it wasn't because of my attending; he was a doll. He talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that I didn't get sued. And I kept asking myself these questions. Why didn't I ask my attending? Why did I send her home? And then at my worst moments: Why did I make such a stupid mistake? Why did I go into medicine? Slowly but surely, it lifted. I began to feel a bit better. And on a cloudy day, there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered, maybe I could feel better again. And I made myself a bargain that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again, please make the voices stop. And they did. And I went back to work. And then it happened again. Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto, and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat. It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry. He kept pointing here. I looked at his throat, it was a little bit pink. And I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way. And even as he was walking out the door, he was still sort of pointing to his throat. And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift, and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office. And she said the three words: Do you remember? ""Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat?"" Well it turns out, he didn't have a strep throat. He had a potentially life-threatening condition called epiglottitis. You can Google it, but it's an infection, not of the throat, but of the upper airway, and it can actually cause the airway to close. And fortunately he didn't die. He was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days. And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again. Twice in one emergency shift, I missed appendicitis. Now that takes some doing, especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night. Now in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think there was any gap in their care. One I thought had a kidney stone. I ordered a kidney X-ray. When it turned out to be normal, my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons. The other one had a lot of diarrhea. I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him and asked my colleague to reassess him. And he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant, called the surgeons. In both cases, they had their operations and they did okay. But each time, they were gnawing at me, eating at me. And I'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say, which is total B.S. (Laughter) Some of my doozies have been in the last five years. Alone, ashamed and unsupported. Here's the problem: If I can't come clean and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the still-small voice that tells me what really happened, how can I share it with my colleagues? How can I teach them about what I did so that they don't do the same thing? If I were to walk into a room ‚Äî like right now, I have no idea what you think of me. When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure? Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor, but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes. If I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I've just told you right now, I probably wouldn't get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable, somebody would crack a joke, they'd change the subject and we would move on. And in fact, if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital, believe me, I'd have trouble making eye contact with that person. That's the system that we have. It's a complete denial of mistakes. It's a system in which there are two kinds of physicians ‚Äî those who make mistakes and those who don't, those who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can, those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes. And it's almost like an ideological reaction, like the antibodies begin to attack that person. And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine, what will we be left with, but a safe system. But there are two problems with that. In my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism, I've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything I can, from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star to my show ""White Coat, Black Art."" And what I've learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous. We work in a system where errors happen every day, where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage, where hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous, causing havoc and death. In this country, as many as 24,000 Canadians die of preventable medical errors. In the United States, the Institute of Medicine pegged it at 100,000. In both cases, these are gross underestimates, because we really aren't ferreting out the problem as we should. And here's the thing. In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years, we can't keep up with it. Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive. We can't get rid of it. We have our cognitive biases, so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain. Now take the same patient with chest pain, make them moist and garrulous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath, and suddenly my history is laced with contempt. I don't take the same history. I'm not a robot; I don't do things the same way each time. And my patients aren't cars; they don't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time. Given all of that, mistakes are inevitable. So if you take the system, as I was taught, and weed out all the error-prone health professionals, well there won't be anybody left. And you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases? On my show, on ""White Coat, Black Art,"" I made it a habit of saying, ""Here's my worst mistake,"" I would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery, ""Here's my worst mistake,"" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, ""What about yours?"" and I would point the microphone towards them. And their pupils would dilate, they would recoil, then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories. They want to tell their stories. They want to share their stories. They want to be able to say, ""Look, don't make the same mistake I did."" What they need is an environment to be able to do that. What they need is a redefined medical culture. And it starts with one physician at a time. The redefined physician is human, knows she's human, accepts it, isn't proud of making mistakes, but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else. She shares her experience with others. She's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes. And she points out other people's mistakes, not in a gotcha way, but in a loving, supportive way so that everybody can benefit. And she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system, and when human beings run the system, they will make mistakes from time to time. So the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving, supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so, and especially people like me, when we do make mistakes, we're rewarded for coming clean. My name is Brian Goldman. I am a redefined physician. I'm human. I make mistakes. I'm sorry about that, but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people. I still don't know what you think of me, but I can live with that. And let me close with three words of my own: I do remember. (Applause)","Chris has been so nice. I don't know how you keep it up, Chris, I really don't. So nice, all week. He's the kind of man you could say to, ""Chris, I'm really sorry, I've crashed your car. And it gets worse, I crashed it into your house. Your house has caught fire. And what's more, your wife has just run off with your best friend.""And you know that Chris would say, ""Thank you."" (Laughter) ""Thank you for sharing, that's really interesting."" (Laughter) ""Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed. Thank you."" (Laughter)One of the ‚Äî (Applause) Thank you for inviting us. One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that, gradually, as the days go by, all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say. (Laughter) Nuclear fusion, I had about 10 minutes on that. Spectroscopy, that was another one. Parallel universes. And so this morning I thought, ""Oh well, I'll just do a card trick."" (Laughter) That one's gone as well. And today is Emmanuel's day, I think we've agreed that, already, haven't we? Emmanuel? Absolutely. (Applause) I was planning on finishing on a dance ... (Laughter) So, that's going to look pretty shabby now.So, what I thought I'd do is ‚Äî in honor of Emmanuel ‚Äî is, what I can do is to launch today the first TED Global auction. If I could start, this is the Enigma decoding machine. (Laughter) Who will start me with $1,000? Anyone?Thank you. Bruno's face, just then, he said, ""No, don't go through this. Don't, please don't. Don't go through this. Don't do it."" (Laughter)I'm worried. When I first got the invitation, they said somewhere in the thing, they said, ""15 minutes to change the world, your moment onstage."" 15 minutes to change the world. I don't know about you, it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug. (Laughter) So, the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one. Well, of course now we know we don't have to change a plug, now we've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric ‚Äî fantastic. You know, it inspires us. 300 years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that. (Laughter) And now it's an idea. (Laughter) It's great. It's fantastic. But you do meet some fantastic people, people who look at the world in a totally different way.Yesterday, David Deutsch, another one who covered most of what I was going to say. (Laughter) But when you think of the world in that way, it does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience, don't you think? I mean, he must walk in and they will say, ""Would you like a macchiato, or a latte, or an Americano, or a cappuccino?"" And he'll say, ""You're offering me things that are infinitely variable."" (Laughter) ""How can your coffee be true?"" (Laughter) And they will say, ""Would you mind if I serve the next customer?"" (Laughter)And Elaine Morgan yesterday, wasn't she wonderful? Fantastic. Really good. Her talk about the aquatic ape, and the link, of course, the link between Darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this ‚Äî we're not hirsute and we can swim rather well. And she said, you know, she's 90. She's running out of time, she said. And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link. And I think, ""I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh."" (Laughter) This man has swum around the North Pole, what more evidence do you want? (Laughter) And there he is. (Applause) That's how TED brings these connections together.I wasn't here on Tuesday. I didn't actually see Gordon Brown's job application ‚Äî um, sorry. (Laughter) I'm so sorry. (Applause) I'm so sorry. No, no. (Applause) No, no, ahh ... (Applause) (As Brown): ""Global problems require Scottish solutions."" (Laughter) The problem I have is because Gordon Brown, he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who's just taken the head off a bear suit.(As Brown): ""Hello, can I tell you what happened in the woods back there? Uh, no."" (Laughter) ""I'm sorry. I've only got 18 minutes, 18 minutes to talk about saving the world, saving the planet, global institutions. Our work on climate change, I've only got 18 minutes, unfortunately I'm not able to tell you about all the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda in Great Britain, like the third runway we're planning at Heathrow Airport ..."" (Laughter) ""The large coal-fired power station we're building at King's North, and of course the exciting news that only today, only this week, Britain's only manufacturer of wind turbines has been forced to close. No time, unfortunately, to mention those."" (Applause) ""British jobs for Scottish people ... No."" (Laughter) ""Christian principles, Christian values. Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife."" (Laughter) ""Although to be honest, when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem."" (Laughter)(As Tony Blair): ""Yeah, alright, come on, eh. Alright Gordon, come on, eh. I just, can I just say a few things about, first about Cherie, because she's a wonderful lady, my wife, with a wonderful smile. That reminds me, I must post that letter."" (Laughter) ""I just think, you know, what people forget, Gordon and I, we always got on perfectly well. Alright, it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'"" (Laughter) ""You know, I wrote to him, just before I left office. I said, 'Can I rely on your support for the next month?' And he wrote back. He said, 'No, you can't.' Which kind of surprised me, because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before."" (Laughter)Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the Mansion House in 2002 ‚Äî that was to the building; the people weren't listening. But the people, when talking about the finance industry, he said, ""What you as the city of London have done for financial services, we, as a government, hope to do for the economy as a whole."" (Laughter) When you think what's happened to financial services, and you see what's happened to the economy, you think, ""Well, there is a man who delivers on his promises."" (Laughter)But we're in a new world now. We're in a completely new world. This is the first time that I can remember, where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan, you don't know if you're borrowing money from him, or if he's borrowing money from you. Am I right?These extraordinary things, Icelandic Internet accounts. Did anyone here have an Icelandic Internet account? Why would you do that? Why would ‚Äî It's like one step up from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria, isn't it? (Laughter) Asking for your bank details. And, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it. It didn't have that kind of collateral. What does it have? It has fish, that's all. That's why the Prime Minister went on television. He said, ""This has left us all with a very big haddock."" (Laughter)A lot of what I do ‚Äî I have to try and make sense of things before I can make nonsense of them. And making sense of the financial crisis is very, very difficult. Luckily, somebody like George Bush was really helpful. He summed it up, really, at a dinner. He was speaking at a dinner, he said, ""Wall Street got drunk."" (Laughter) ""And now it's got a hangover."" And that's, you know, that's something ‚Äî (Applause) And that's something we can relate to. It's certainly something he can relate to. (Laughter)And the other one, of course, is Donald Rumsfeld, who said, ""There are the known knowns, the things we know we know. And then you got the known unknowns, the things we know we don't know. And then you got the unknown unknowns, those are the things we don't know we don't know."" And being English, when I first heard that I thought, ""What a load of cock."" And then, you're now, well, actually, that's what this is about.This whole, what Ben Bernanke has said, the chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system, it's about ‚Äî they don't know, they didn't know what they were doing. In 2006, the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said, quote, ""As we can clearly see, no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the U.S. economy."" Now, there is a man on top of his job. (Laughter) And when the crisis was happening, the head of quantitative equities at Lehman Brothers said, ""Events which models predicted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days.""So, it's extraordinary. It's a new world that's very, very difficult to make sense of. But we have a new hope. We have a new man. America has now elected its first openly black President. (Laughter) Wonderful news. Not only that, he's left-handed. Have you noticed this? How many people here are left-handed? You see, a lot of the people that I most admire, they're great artists, great designers, great thinkers, they're left-handed. And somebody said to me last night, you know, being left-handed, you have to learn to write without smudging the ink. And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday. And I thought, what a wonderful metaphor, isn't it? An American President who has to write without smudging the ink.You like that one? As opposed to you could see George Bush, well, what's the metaphor there? I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing, wouldn't it? ""Well, you know I'm sorry about that. I'm right-handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well."" (Laughter) But, you know, he's gone. Now he's gone. That's eight years of American History, eight minutes of my act, just gone like that.""You know, it's the end of an error [sic]. I happen to believe it was a great error. I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the United States. But we proved them wrong in Iraq. They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda. There is now."" (Laughter) ""But I have a message for the suicide bombers, for those people who've blown themselves up."" (Laughter) ""We're going to find you."" (Laughter) ""We're going to make sure you don't do it again."" (Laughter)But now he's gone, and it's great to see one of the ‚Äî arguably one of the worst speech makers in American history, now given way to one of the greatest, in Obama. You were there, maybe, on the night of his victory. And he spoke to the crowd in Chicago, he said, ""If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible ..."" I can't do the whole thing because it would take too long, it really would. (Laughter) But you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration. And he and the Chief Justice, they trip over each other, they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up. And there is George Bush sitting there going, ""Heh heh heh heh ..."" (Laughter) ""Not so easy is it? Heh heh heh."" (Laughter)But the interesting thing is, Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero, who said, people would listen to a speech, they said, ""Great speech."" And then they'd listen to Demosthenes, and they'd say, ""Let's march."" And we all want to believe in President Obama. It's rather like that line in the film ""As Good As it Gets."" Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson, and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson, ""What do you see in me?"" And Jack Nicholson just says, ""You make me want to be a better man.""And you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen. Right? But at the moment, it's a Cicero thing. We like what Barack Obama says, but we don't do anything about it. So he comes over to this country, and he says, ""We need a big fiscal stimulus."" And everyone goes, ""Great!"" He leaves the country and the French and the Germans go, ""No, no, forget about that, absolutely not."" Nothing happens. He goes to Strasburg. He says, ""We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan."" And everyone goes, ""Great idea."" He leaves, people go, ""No no no, we're not going to do that. 5,000 maximum, and no rockets. No, no, not going to do it."" He goes to Prague, he says, ""We believe in a nuclear-free world.""And it's great to have an American president who can say the word ""nuclear,"" let's just point that out first. Do you remember that? George Bush, ""A nu-ca-ler."" Sorry, what? ""A nu-ca-ler."" (Laughter) Could you say ""avuncular""? ""Avunclear."" (Laughter) Thank you very much.But he says, ""We want a nuclear-free world."" And that day, North Korea, that very day, North Korea is just seeing if it can just get one over Japan ‚Äî (Laughter) ‚Äî and land it before ...So, where do we look for inspiration? We've still got Bill Clinton. ""Travels the world."" (Laughs) ""I believe, I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ..."" (Laughter) ""Tell a lie; it was Diana Ross ..."" (Laughter) ""... who said, reach out and touch ..."" (Laughter) ""... somebody's gla ‚Äî hand."" (Laughter) ""Make this world a better place, if you can. I just think that's important. I really do. And I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House, because she'd have been out of our home for four years. And I, you know."" (Laughter) ""So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you."" (Laughter)So, there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles: ""And the environment is so important, all we can do. My wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to push emissions up her agenda."" (Laughter)Or, any South Africans, we have Mandela to inspire. Mandela, the great man Mandela. He's been honored with a statue now. The previous highest honor he had in Britain was a visit from the team from Ground Force, a gardening program. ""So, Nelson, how would you like a nice water feature?"" ""Ahh, listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh."" (Laughter) ""I was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean. Why would I need a bloody water feature?"" (Laughter)Very quickly: I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote from the ""Japanese Essays on Idleness"" which said it's nice to have something which is unfinished because it implies there is still room for growth. Thank you very much indeed. (Applause)","A few months ago the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to two teams of astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one of the most important astronomical observations ever. And today, after briefly describing what they found, I'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explaining their discovery, namely the possibility that way beyond the Earth, the Milky Way and other distant galaxies, we may find that our universe is not the only universe, but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse.Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one. I mean, most of us were raised to believe that the word ""universe"" means everything. And I say most of us with forethought, as my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born. And last year I was holding her and I said, ""Sophia, I love you more than anything in the universe."" And she turned to me and said, ""Daddy, universe or multiverse?"" (Laughter)But barring such an anomalous upbringing, it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours, most with fundamentally different features, that would rightly be called universes of their own. And yet, speculative though the idea surely is, I aim to convince you that there's reason for taking it seriously, as it just might be right. I'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts. In part one, I'm going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results and to highlight a profound mystery which those results revealed. In part two, I'll offer a solution to that mystery. It's based on an approach called string theory, and that's where the idea of the multiverse will come into the story. Finally, in part three, I'm going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation, which will pull all the pieces of the story together.Okay, part one starts back in 1929 when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us, establishing that space itself is stretching, it's expanding. Now this was revolutionary. The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static. But even so, there was one thing that everyone was certain of: The expansion must be slowing down. That, much as the gravitational pull of the Earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward, the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing the expansion of space.Now let's fast-forward to the 1990s when those two teams of astronomers I mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing. And they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies, allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time. Here's the surprise: They found that the expansion is not slowing down. Instead they found that it's speeding up, going faster and faster. That's like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster. Now if you saw an apple do that, you'd want to know why. What's pushing on it?Similarly, the astronomers' results are surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize, but they raised an analogous question. What force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever-quickening speed? Well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of Einstein's. You see, we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing, pulls objects together. But in Einstein's theory of gravity, his general theory of relativity, gravity can also push things apart.How? Well according to Einstein's math, if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy, sort of like a uniform, invisible mist, then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive, repulsive gravity, which is just what we need to explain the observations. Because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space ‚Äî we now call it dark energy, but I've made it smokey white here so you can see it ‚Äî its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other, driving expansion to speed up, not slow down. And this explanation represents great progress.But I promised you a mystery here in part one. Here it is. When the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up, look at what they found. This number is small. Expressed in the relevant unit, it is spectacularly small. And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number. We want this number to emerge from the laws of physics, but so far no one has found a way to do that.Now you might wonder, should you care? Maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue, a technical detail of interest to experts, but of no relevance to anybody else. Well it surely is a technical detail, but some details really matter. Some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality, and this peculiar number may be doing just that, as the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes ‚Äî an idea that naturally emerges from string theory, which takes me to part two: string theory.So hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three key things about string theory. First off, what is it? Well it's an approach to realize Einstein's dream of a unified theory of physics, a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe. And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward. It says that if you examine any piece of matter ever more finely, at first you'll find molecules and then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles. But the theory says that if you could probe smaller, much smaller than we can with existing technology, you'd find something else inside these particles ‚Äî a little tiny vibrating filament of energy, a little tiny vibrating string. And just like the strings on a violin, they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes. These little fundamental strings, when they vibrate in different patterns, they produce different kinds of particles ‚Äî so electrons, quarks, neutrinos, photons, all other particles would be united into a single framework, as they would all arise from vibrating strings. It's a compelling picture, a kind of cosmic symphony, where all the richness that we see in the world around us emerges from the music that these little, tiny strings can play.But there's a cost to this elegant unification, because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work. It has internal inconsistencies, unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar ‚Äî extra dimensions of space. That is, we all know about the usual three dimensions of space. And you can think about those as height, width and depth. But string theory says that, on fantastically small scales, there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them. But even though the dimensions are hidden, they would have an impact on things that we can observe because the shape of the extra dimensions constrains how the strings can vibrate. And in string theory, vibration determines everything. So particle masses, the strengths of forces, and most importantly, the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions. So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions, we should be able to calculate these features, calculate the amount of dark energy.The challenge is we don't know the shape of the extra dimensions. All we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math. Now when these ideas were first developed, there were only about five different candidate shapes, so you can imagine analyzing them one-by-one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe. But over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes. From five, the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands ‚Äî A large, but still manageable, collection to analyze, since after all, graduate students need something to do. But then the list continued to grow into the millions and the billions, until today. The list of candidate shapes has soared to about 10 to the 500.So, what to do? Well some researchers lost heart, concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions, each giving rise to different physical features, string theory would never make definitive, testable predictions. But others turned this issue on its head, taking us to the possibility of a multiverse. Here's the idea. Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other. Each is as real as every other, in the sense that there are many universes, each with a different shape, for the extra dimensions. And this radical proposal has a profound impact on this mystery: the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results.Because you see, if there are other universes, and if those universes each have, say, a different shape for the extra dimensions, then the physical features of each universe will be different, and in particular, the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different. Which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we've now measured would take on a wholly different character. In this context, the laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy because there isn't just one number, there are many numbers. Which means we have been asking the wrong question. It's that the right question to ask is, why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we've measured instead of any of the other possibilities that are out there?And that's a question on which we can make headway. Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours, whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies, the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies don't form. And in those universes that have much less dark energy, well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that, again, galaxies don't form. And without galaxies, there are no stars, no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes.So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we've measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form of life. And that would be that. Mystery solved, multiverse found. Now some find this explanation unsatisfying. We're used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe. But the point is, if the feature you're observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality, then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided.An early example comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number ‚Äî why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth. And he worked for decades trying to explain this number, but he never succeeded, and we know why. Kepler was asking the wrong question.We now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars. So hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number, 93 million miles, well that is simply wrongheaded. Instead the right question to ask is, why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance, instead of any of the other possibilities? And again, that's a question we can answer. Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn't exist. And those planets that are much farther away from the star, well they're so cold that, again, our form of life would not take hold. So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life. And when it comes to planets and their distances, this clearly is the right kind of reasoning. The point is, when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain, it may also be the right kind of reasoning.One key difference, of course, is we know that there are other planets out there, but so far I've only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes. So to pull it all together, we need a mechanism that can actually generate other universes. And that takes me to my final part, part three. Because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang. You see, when we speak of the Big Bang, we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward.But there's a little secret. The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important, the Bang. It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang, but gives us no insight into what would have powered the Bang itself. And this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory. It's called inflationary cosmology, which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space. The fuel is based on something called a quantum field, but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it's virtually impossible to use it all up, which means in the inflationary theory, the Big Bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one-time event. Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang, but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs, each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes.And now, when we meld this with string theory, here's the picture we're led to. Each of these universes has extra dimensions. The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes. The different shapes yield different physical features. And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it's only in our universe that the physical features, like the amount of dark energy, are right for our form of life to take hold. And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos that cutting-edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously consider.One big remaining question, of course, is, could we ever confirm the existence of other universes? Well let me describe one way that might one day happen. The inflationary theory already has strong observational support. Because the theory predicts that the Big Bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded, tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world, yielding a distinctive fingerprint, a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots, across space, which powerful telescopes have now observed. Going further, if there are other universes, the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide. And if our universe got hit by another, that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect. And so exotic as this picture is, it may one day be grounded in observations, establishing the existence of other universes.I'll conclude with a striking implication of all these ideas for the very far future. You see, we learned that our universe is not static, that space is expanding, that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies. But because the expansion is speeding up, in the very far future, those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won't be able to see them ‚Äî not because of technological limitations, but because of the laws of physics. The light those galaxies emit, even traveling at the fastest speed, the speed of light, will not be able to overcome the ever-widening gulf between us. So astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static, inky, black stillness. And they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit ‚Äî a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong.Now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era, like ours, attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies. But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge? Or would they believe in the black, static empty universe that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal? I suspect the latter. Which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration. It appears that it may not always be that way. Because today's astronomers, by turning powerful telescopes to the sky, have captured a handful of starkly informative photons ‚Äî a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit. and the message echoing across the ages is clear. Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law. Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon.Thank you very much.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Brian, thank you. The range of ideas you've just spoken about are dizzying, exhilarating, incredible. How do you think of where cosmology is now, in a sort of historical side? Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion?BG: Well it's hard to say. When we learn that astronomers of the far future may not have enough information to figure things out, the natural question is, maybe we're already in that position and certain deep, critical features of the universe already have escaped our ability to understand because of how cosmology evolves. So from that perspective, maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them.On the other hand, we now can understand how old the universe is. We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago ‚Äî and yet, we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches. Holy cow! That's just amazing. So on the one hand, it's just incredible where we've gotten, but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future.CA: You're going to be around for the next few days. Maybe some of these conversations can continue. Thank you. Thank you, Brian. (BG: My pleasure.)(Applause)","So I've been thinking about the difference between the r√©sum√© virtues and the eulogy virtues. The r√©sum√© virtues are the ones you put on your r√©sum√©, which are the skills you bring to the marketplace. The eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy, which are deeper: who are you, in your depth, what is the nature of your relationships, are you bold, loving, dependable, consistency? And most of us, including me, would say that the eulogy virtues are the more important of the virtues. But at least in my case, are they the ones that I think about the most? And the answer is no.So I've been thinking about that problem, and a thinker who has helped me think about it is a guy named Joseph Soloveitchik, who was a rabbi who wrote a book called ""The Lonely Man Of Faith"" in 1965. Soloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures, which he called Adam I and Adam II. Adam I is the worldly, ambitious, external side of our nature. He wants to build, create, create companies, create innovation. Adam II is the humble side of our nature. Adam II wants not only to do good but to be good, to live in a way internally that honors God, creation and our possibilities. Adam I wants to conquer the world. Adam II wants to hear a calling and obey the world. Adam I savors accomplishment. Adam II savors inner consistency and strength. Adam I asks how things work. Adam II asks why we're here. Adam I's motto is ""success."" Adam II's motto is ""love, redemption and return.""And Soloveitchik argued that these two sides of our nature are at war with each other. We live in perpetual self-confrontation between the external success and the internal value. And the tricky thing, I'd say, about these two sides of our nature is they work by different logics. The external logic is an economic logic: input leads to output, risk leads to reward. The internal side of our nature is a moral logic and often an inverse logic. You have to give to receive. You have to surrender to something outside yourself to gain strength within yourself. You have to conquer the desire to get what you want. In order to fulfill yourself, you have to forget yourself. In order to find yourself, you have to lose yourself.We happen to live in a society that favors Adam I, and often neglects Adam II. And the problem is, that turns you into a shrewd animal who treats life as a game, and you become a cold, calculating creature who slips into a sort of mediocrity where you realize there's a difference between your desired self and your actual self. You're not earning the sort of eulogy you want, you hope someone will give to you. You don't have the depth of conviction. You don't have an emotional sonorousness. You don't have commitment to tasks that would take more than a lifetime to commit.I was reminded of a common response through history of how you build a solid Adam II, how you build a depth of character. Through history, people have gone back into their own pasts, sometimes to a precious time in their life, to their childhood, and often, the mind gravitates in the past to a moment of shame, some sin committed, some act of selfishness, an act of omission, of shallowness, the sin of anger, the sin of self-pity, trying to be a people-pleaser, a lack of courage. Adam I is built by building on your strengths. Adam II is built by fighting your weaknesses. You go into yourself, you find the sin which you've committed over and again through your life, your signature sin out of which the others emerge, and you fight that sin and you wrestle with that sin, and out of that wrestling, that suffering, then a depth of character is constructed. And we're often not taught to recognize the sin in ourselves, in that we're not taught in this culture how to wrestle with it, how to confront it, and how to combat it. We live in a culture with an Adam I mentality where we're inarticulate about Adam II.Finally, Reinhold Niebuhr summed up the confrontation, the fully lived Adam I and Adam II life, this way: ""Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime; therefore we must be saved by hope. Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; therefore we must be saved by faith. Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone; therefore we must be saved by love. No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as from our own standpoint. Therefore we must be saved by that final form of love, which is forgiveness.‚ÄùThanks.(Applause)"

This ripe selection bursts with flavors of yellow fruit and citrus, touched by wood influence. Drink it over the next year, or age it for 3‚Äì4.","Campo del Drago Brunello boasts a soft, modern style with creamy chocolate and opulent cherry overtones. The wine is almost ready to drink (try it after 2014) but would also make a promising candidate for more years of cellar aging.","A very nice red wine for drinking now with foods from all sorts of ethnicities and styles. Made from a bunch of varieties, including Cabernet, Grenache and Tempranillo, the wine is dry and tannic, with deep flavors of blackberries, black currants, anise and sweet, smoky sandalwood.","Roll out the barrel as far as aromas go; it's got a lot of toast and popcorn. The palate is creamy and smooth, with apple, peach and a fairly high level of sweetness. Regular on the finish, with some leftover popcorn and spiced apple.","The bouquet immediately draws you in with aromas of sweet pea florals, fresh grass, ripe gooseberry and preserved Meyer lemon. The medium-weight mouths offers slightly riper nuances of stone fruit but ends with a tangy citrus-infused finish."

Lengthy and complexly woven, it has a gravelly edge of minerality to its texture and taste.","The aroma of charred oak dominates this Malbec, while oak tannins rule the palate. The underyling wine is soft and fruity and tannic in itself, with blackberry and currant flavors. Big and hefty, it's a wine to drink with superrich fare, like barbecue or meat stews.","Damo has earthy fragrances of tobacco leaf, underbrush and truffle, along with notes of raspberry and spice. The palate shows ripe black cherry, vanilla and sweet spice flavors, as well as a hint of licorice. This has nice depth and balance, but will be more complex after 2017.","Earthy and a touch shy at first, with lightly floral aromas that blend well with the scents of baked plum, prune and blackberry. It's heavy and cheek-grabbing, but also hugely flavorful and loaded with cassis, blackberry, herbs and tobacco. Long as a marathon on the finish. Drink from 2011 through 2014. 1,000 cases made.","This is a sweet Gewurztraminer, almost a dessert style. The name comes from a title whose origins date back to the Dark Ages in Europe. The wine is rich, now fully matured, a wonderful medley of ripe fruits, honey and spice. Layers of flavors are interspersed with acidity that lifts the wine. It's opulent, delicious and ready to drink."

  Take turns to roll the three die together. The dice with functions on tells you whether to add, subtract or multiply the two numbers showing on the other die. So if you get a 6 and an 8 and the function dice says multiply, then your score is 48. If the next player scores more than 48 he/she wins a cupcake. If they score less than 48, you win the cupcake. If one of you throws an Aaahh, then you throw again and if it's another Aaahh, you lose that round. The first player to win all 3 cupcakes wins the game. If one player has two cupcakes and the other has one cupcake, you have to keep playing rounds until you can take the third cupcake from the other player. The children I play it with love this game, it's very quick.

A stable financial system that promotes efficient savings and investment is also crucial for a thriving democracy and market economy.
 
 There are several aspects of access to financial services: availability, cost, and quality of services. The development and growth of credit markets depend on access to timely, reliable, and accurate data on borrowers' credit experiences. Access to credit can be improved by making it easy to create and enforce collateral agreements and by increasing information about potential borrowers' creditworthiness. Lenders look at a borrower's credit history and collateral. Where credit registries and effective collateral laws are absent - as in many developing countries - banks make fewer loans. Indicators that cover getting credit include the strength of legal rights index and the depth of credit information index.","Population estimates are usually based on national population censuses. Estimates for the years before and after the census are interpolations or extrapolations based on demographic models. Errors and undercounting occur even in high-income countries; in developing countries errors may be substantial because of limits in the transport, communications, and other resources required conducting and analyzing a full census.
 
 Population density is a measure of the intensity of land-use, and can be calculated for a block, city, county, state, country, continent or the entire world. Considering that over half of the Earth's land mass consists of areas inhospitable to human inhabitation, such as deserts and high mountains, and that population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh water sources, a simple number of population density by itself does not give any meaningful measurement of human population density.
 
 Several of the most densely populated territories in the world are city-states, microstates, or dependencies.[6][7] These territories share a relatively small area and a high urbanization level, with an economically specialized city population drawing also on rural resources outside the area, illustrating the difference between high population density and overpopulation.","Adjusted net savings measure the change in value of a specified set of assets, excluding capital gains. If a country's net savings are positive and the accounting includes a sufficiently broad range of assets, economic theory suggests that the present value of social welfare is increasing. Conversely, persistently negative adjusted net savings indicate that an economy is on an unsustainable path.",The World Bank Group's goal of promoting shared prosperity has been defined as fostering income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the welfare distribution in every country. Income distribution data and the Gini coefficient measure inequality in income or consumption and important indicators for measuring shared prosperity.,"The share of enrollment in private institutions indicates the scale and capacity of private education within a country. A high percentage suggests strong involvement of the non-governmental sector (including religious bodies, other organizations, associations, communities, private enterprises or persons) in providing organized educational programmes. However, in countries where private institutions are substantially subsidized or aided by the government, the distinction between private and public educational institutions may be less clear-cut especially when certain students are directly financed through government scholarships."

 The quality and reliability of official demographic data are also affected by public trust in the government, government commitment to full and accurate enumeration, confidentiality and protection against misuse of census data, and census agencies' independence from political influence. Moreover, comparability of population indicators is limited by differences in the concepts, definitions, collection procedures, and estimation methods used by national statistical agencies and other organizations that collect the data.
 
 The currentness of a census and the availability of complementary data from surveys or registration systems are objective ways to judge demographic data quality. Some European countries' registration systems offer complete information on population in the absence of a census.
 
 The United Nations Statistics Division monitors the completeness of vital registration systems. Some developing countries have made progress over the last 60 years, but others still have deficiencies in civil registration systems.
 
 International migration is the only other factor besides birth and death rates that directly determines a country's population growth. Estimating migration is difficult. At any time many people are located outside their home country as tourists, workers, or refugees or for other reasons. Standards for the duration and purpose of international moves that qualify as migration vary, and estimates require information on flows into and out of countries that is difficult to collect.
 
 Population projections, starting from a base year are projected forward using assumptions of mortality, fertility, and migration by age and sex through 2050, based on the UN Population Division's World Population Prospects database medium variant.","The Liner Shipping Connectivity Index captures how well countries are connected to global shipping networks. It is computed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) based on five components of the maritime transport sector: number of ships, their container-carrying capacity, maximum vessel size, number of services, and number of companies that deploy container ships in a country's ports. The data are derived from Containerisation International Online (www.ci-online.co.uk). For each of the five components, a country's value is divided by the maximum value of that component in 2004, and for each country, the average of the five components is calculated. This average is then divided by the maximum average for 2004 and multiplied by 100. In this way, the index generates the value 100 for the country with the highest average index of the five components in 2004.","The rate of out-of-school adolescents allows to compare across countries with different population sizes. It shows the share of official lower secondary age adolescents who never attended school or dropped out to the population of official lower secondary school age.
 
 Data on education are collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its annual education survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current version was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011. Population data are drawn from the United Nations Population Division. Using a single source for population data standardizes definitions, estimations, and interpolation methods, ensuring a consistent methodology across countries and minimizing potential enumeration problems in national censuses. The reference years reflect the school year for which the data are presented. In some countries the school year spans two calendar years (for example, from September 2010 to June 2011); in these cases the reference year refers to the year in which the school year ended (2011 in the example).","The World Bank's Doing Business measures the time and cost (excluding tariffs) associated with exporting and importing a standardized cargo of goods by sea transport. The time and cost necessary to complete every official procedure for exporting and importing the goods are recorded; however, the time and cost for sea transport are not included. All documents needed by the trader to export or import the goods across the border are also recorded. For exporting goods, procedures range from packing the goods into the container at the warehouse to their departure from the port of exit. For importing goods, procedures range from the vessel's arrival at the port of entry to the cargo's delivery at the warehouse. For landlocked economies, these include procedures at the inland border post, since the port is located in the transit economy. Payment is made by letter of credit, and the time, cost and documents required for the issuance or advising of a letter of credit are taken into account. The ranking on the ease of trading across borders is the simple average of the percentile rankings on its component indicators.
 
 Local freight forwarders, shipping lines, customs brokers, port officials and banks provide information on required documents and cost as well as the time to complete each procedure. To make the data comparable across economies, several assumptions about the business and the traded goods are used.
 
 Cost measures the fees levied on a 20-foot container in U.S. dollars. All the fees associated with completing the procedures to export or import the goods are taken into account. These include costs for documents, administrative fees for customs clearance and inspections, customs broker fees, port-related charges and inland transport costs. The cost does not include customs tariffs and duties or costs related to sea transport. Only official costs are recorded.","Internally displaced persons are ""persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized state border."" Internally displaced people are often confused with refugees. Unlike refugees, internally displaced people remain under the protection of their own government, even if their reason for fleeing was similar to that of refugees. Refugees are people who have crossed an international border to find sanctuary and have been granted refugee or refugee-like status or temporary protection."

233,text,3,3122,0,0,3019,96.7008328,0,0,0,0,"I'm not sure what it was. Might have been the Predator movies, might have been something else. Heat vision. The ability to see heat was something I wanted for a while. Back in the old days, however, any sort of a heat vision camera cost more than I'd made in a decade. You might think ""superpower!"", but that's not what I had in mind. I had an idea, an image in my mind. Something that is trivial to photoshop, but is absurdly hard to actually see. Things and scenes lit up by the light emitted from a human. The glow of our heat lighting up the scene. What would it take to make a picture like that? What makes a camera? And how can you make a heat-seeing camera yourself? Centuries ago it was known that if you stand inside a dark box on a sunny day and poke a hole in one of the walls, you'll get the image of the outside on the other wall. In the days of photography this concept became known as a pinhole camera. The diffraction of light producing the image. It's a mechanism that is independent of the nature and wavelength of radiation it is being used with. At the back of the box there was a glass plate in the earlier cameras, then film, then a digital sensor - something that can record the image. Of course, the pinhole was quickly replaced with more efficient optics, like lenses. But for our goal it's important to remember, because infrared light does not pass through glass. Which light? There are many bands of invisible light out there. The visible spectrum is, as the name suggests, what we see. Above it, the shorter waves are the ultraviolet - light which is progressively more harmful, and also progressively dimmer due to our opaque atmosphere. Nice to try, not that interesting to linger there. Below, the longer waves are the bands of infrared. You might have seen the online guides on how to turn your digital camera into an ""infrared camera"". Some even have the nerve to call it ""heat vision"" camera. How that hack works is based on the fact that the light response of silicon detectors used in most cameras includes the near infrared (NIR) band, which is just below the visible red. To approximate what the eye would see, the cameras are fitted with a filter (""Hot mirror""). Silicon sensitivity: Human eye sensitivity: NIR is an interesting band - the grass and leaves are reflective in it, and you can get some surreal images of pitch black sky with brilliant-white trees. But it's not heat vision: you have to be 400¬∞ C or higher hot to glow in NIR. Below the NIR there are: SWIR - the short-wave infrared that is used in optic fiber communications. MWIR - the middle/medium-wave IR, where things start to get interesting - you glow at just over 100¬∞ C. And LWIR -long/far-wave IR where all the glowy human stuff happens. Unfortunately, glass is opaque below NIR and can't be used in heat vision cameras. There are optical materials that pass and focus the lower bands, but they all cost money and are difficult to get. This is where the pinhole camera comes into play - a pinhole focuses everything you shine through it, eliminating the need for an exotic lens. So, how do you make a digital camera? We start with a light-proof box. In the box there is a coin-sized hole. Over the hole there is the flap with the pinhole, poked with a needle in a piece of aluminum foil. Inside the box is a coordinate table - an X-Y scanning rig to rasterize the image. A regular digital camera would have a matrix - huge array of detectors all working in parallel. That can't be made at home. What can be made at home is a single light detector, based on a photodiode. The signal from the photodiode gets amplified by a huge factor with a transimpedance amplifier , then fed through an ADC to get the digital data for the microcontroller to store on a microSD card. Gigaohm resistors are needed to get the right gain. Fortunately, they were made in USSR and the stock still exists. This detector is mounted on the caret of the X-Y rig which scans it across the image - up and down, left, up and down, left - repeat a thousand times and you get a picture!... ...of noise. The amount of sensitivity needed to pick up the faint light from the pinhole is massive. And we live in the age of AC electricity - an omnipresent hum at 50Hz. Fortunately, it's easy to filter out with an age-old arrangement known as a Faraday cage . Radio waves cannot penetrate into a conductor, so if you wrap your box with metal foil and use the foil as your ground reference, then the noise vanishes. And you start to see something. More amplification, and new noise appears. Now it's the motors and internal electronics. The gains are enormous and everything that can be picked up gets picked up. We need more foil. Much more foil... Actually, the foil above was an early failed experiment, and the foil below is all it takes - just put the actual detector into it's own faraday cage! With that done, the picture clears up. Not much noise left. A megapixel worth of vision, wrought by your own hands. What would the sunset look like? Not great, I guess. It's still a black and white camera. Let's improve on that. To get colors we need more sensors. But first, let's fast forward a bit. This project spans years, and when I started there were no 3D printers. Eventually I made one, and all the clumsiness of the old rig got replaced with modern, 3D printed, well-fitted parts. Sensor shielding got a solidity improvement as well. Most importantly, I moved the ADC into the sensor box, and that allowed me to attach many boxes on the same digital bus. Add some filters... And you can start seeing the shades of the world. There are many types of light bulbs. Let's look at a room with infrared (red) and visible (blue) filters. See how the lights have distinct colors? The bright red are incandescent, spewing out infrared waste. The blue are CCFLs, barely producing anything but visible. Efficiency vision! Spot the LEDs. Remember how I said grass is reflective in the NIR? Let's combine NIR, green and blue. But back to the true color. Outdoors. Indoors. The bands are there because the sensors are separated by some distance, so the images don't overlap completely. And of course, no camera would be complete without a self-portrait. It takes 5 minutes to complete a picture, so here i am reading about color balancing algorithms on a phone and trying not to move. It's surprisingly not easy to get the colors right when all you have is the raw red, green and blue channels. I'll never curse ""whoever programmed the Auto White Balance on that stupid camera"" again. But what about the unseen ? The whole idea was to see what no one saw before. That's a whole another story. The first part of it is easy - let's look at the ultraviolet. Thick, opaque air. Dark landscapes. A sun that looks dim. You don't really see the ozone layer, just the air itself glowing - same blue sky, only thicker. Would have been nice to see the fog of the ozone, but it's hidden behind the air. Now, for the magic. To see in MWIR, we need an InAs photodiode, something that's not really that easy to come by. They are made by a Japanese company Hamamatsu, and do not cost that much. Or so I thought... This was my first encounter with ITAR - the ""how dare you want interesting stuff?"" restrictions. Before then I never realized just how USA, uh..., loves the whole world. Basically, the Hamamatsu guys wanted me to provide a ton of paperwork proving that I won't be making nuclear bombs and guided missiles with their parts, cause that's what they are commonly used for. MWIR is where jet fighters glow brightly in front of a pitch-black sky. Well, crap. Fortunately, we in Russia also know how to make heat-seeking missiles, and after some searching I found a local supplier that was more than happy to provide me with a couple of 3.4 Œºm InAs photodiodes. That is where the trip into the never-before-seen begins. And it begins with figuring out that all of the above assumptions about pinholes and billion-to-one amplifiers don't apply. First, the InAs photodiode drifts. A lot. That's what a blank picture looks like. Then, with a pinhole and maximum gain I can give it, that's what a soldering iron looks like: Okay. The purpose of the problems is to be solved. Let's dump the pinhole and order a ZnSe lens from China. Turns out that since the project's inception the situation changed - China was making plenty of CO2 lasers, which use ZnSe lenses. And these lenses focus the light I need perfectly fine. Oh, and they are very cheap. Some 3D printing later i got a proper lens assembly with focus capability. In the dark of the night you can see a lot with it now (regular photodiode). Next, the drift. It's not that fast, and we can assume that it's stable during one scan line. So, let's add a flap at the end... And modify the processing software to even out the image based on the reference band. Let's look at that soldering iron again. The most amazing part is not that it glows, but that it glows brightly enough to illuminate the stand. It's not just the ""temperature mapped to an image"" of a regular heat vision camera, we see the actual long-wave light being emitted and reflected - a soldering iron turned into a lightbulb! The low limit for the glow is somewhere around 100*C. Here are some hot resistors: MWIR is neither heat, nor is it light. It's both - if you look outside you'll see the world illuminated by the MWIR radiation from our sun. These kinds of scenes were never seen before by anyone. Outside of, perhaps, some specialty labs that make sensors and the people who built the cameras for the climate watching satellites like Terra and Aqua . What other sensors are there? I mentioned SWIR, the band that is used for the optic fiber. There, the parts are easy to come by and are not restricted. Unfortunately, the SWIR photodiode is also sensitive to the regular light. Fortunately, silicon is opaque all the way to upper SWIR, so it would filter out all the things we don't want to see. Unfortunately, the raw silicon wafers you can find on ebay are not really transparent. Looking at a lightbulb through it produces only a blur. Fortunately, my father's old solar panel fab is still in business and they have some scrap of wafer-grade silicon. That worked great. Let's look around. Eh, it's kinda cute but not that special. Same deep black sky the NIR is famous for. The snow is almost black, since there is no sky light for it to reflect I guess. Big difference is that the vegetation is not as reflective, so you get the ""blackness of space"" sky with regular-ish landscapes. It's almost like being on the airless, derelict Earth - preserved under the void after whatever disaster befell it. That is about all I got as far as sights not seen before go. Unfortunately, no sensor that I can easily get or use can see deep enough in the LWIR to make the humans glow. You need liquid nitrogen cooling on an InGaAs photodiode to do that, and it's not quite that easy to get. So the story will continue. You might wonder about a few bits of this build, a few words I said and a few unusual solutions. All of them hint at another use in mind. Another kind of radiation to see in...? Oh yes, there is one more. But that would be a whole other story, for another time. Stay tuned!","Learn how to create a hierarchical tree listing all the files and folders in your Google Drive. The Drive tree can also be printed or saved for later. If you have ever worked with DOS or Linux before, you'll be familiar with the ""tree"" command that recursively lists all the files and folders in the current directory in a tree like format. Most of us prefer visual navigation through Windows Explorer or Mac Finder but a unique advantage with the tree command is that you can save and print the directory structure. Tree Command for your Google Drive I have written a little Google Script that is much like running ""tree"" but against your Google Drive. It creates a hierarchical tree diagram of all the files and folders in your Google Drive that you can save for offline reference or even print. To get started, click here and authorize the script to access the files in your Google Drive. Once the authorization is complete, it may take a minute to generate the entire Google Drive tree. You'll then get a link to download an HTML file that mirrors your Drive structure. You can directly send the file to the printer as well. Internally, all the script does is recursive traversal and the tree itself is sylized through simple CSS. In the current version, only the folder names in the tree are linked to their corresponding location in your Google Drive though the script can be easily extended to create a more data-rich tree that includes details like file URLs, sharing permissions , file sizes, file types and so on. The process may take slightly longer if you have a large drive with tons of file and folders. Also, as soon as you authorize the Google Drive Tree script, you'll get an email from Google with instructions on how to revoke access. You can do so as soon as the tree has been generated.","To make my coming point about why Drupal needs ecommerce, we need to take a detour into the world of Drupal distributions and the potential for building Software-as-a-Service products. I have long advocated for using Drupal as a tool for creating web products. Since Drupal is better than its peers at creating distributions (packaged sites that address a specific use case), it seems to logically follow that these distributions could become hosted SaaS products. While many SaaS products are multi-tenant, meaning they direct all customers to the same installation of the tool and use permissions to set up walls between the users, some tools are single-tenant SaaS, meaning each customer gets their own copy of the entire tool. Drupal fits beautifully into the single-tenant paradigm, and we're seeing some very interesting new Drupal 8 based products emerge, such as Open Social . The recipe for creating single-tenant SaaS products using Drupal is this: Build a great distribution that solves a specific problem well enough to be useful out-of-the-box Create an ecommerce site where people can sign up for an account (a hosted copy of the distribution) When a customer signs up, provide them with a hosted version of your distribution. The hosting should be able to pull updates from a central repository (eg. use Composer to build). Extra points if the hosting solution can also support adding bespoke code to individual customers' SaaS installations Use monthly billing to charge for basic service and extras, such as theming or integration work, consulting, add-on features, or improved SLAs Fortunately for Drupal SaaS creators, Drupal Commerce has exactly the capabilities that are needed to set up recurring billing plans that can model any structure in point #4, including pre- or post- payment, metered billing, packages of services, invoicing and all of the things you'd need to make your distribution into a product. The central benefit of pursuing a SaaS strategy with Drupal is that you as the ISV get to focus on improving your product, benefitting all of your customers. The business model provides you with recurring revenue, hopefully helping you fund further investment in your product, and in Drupal. My point in diverging into SaaS is that Drupal will never achieve what once seemed like an obvious win‚Ää-‚Ääto become the premiere tool for making specialised, vertically targeted distributions‚Ää-‚Ääunless Drupal is also capable of being a solid ecommerce platform. Anyone who has any interest in seeing more companies build actual products based on Drupal will want to help Drupal improve its ecommerce capabilities and build upon the great work that has already been done. For example, the recurring billing and license modelling work that I linked to still only exists for Drupal 7‚Ää-‚Ääthere is not yet a Drupal 8 version. Next: 4. Why ecommerce is essential for Drupal","How can we improve our emotional intelligence, and what are the benefits? originally appeared on Quora -- the knowledge-sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights . Answer by Chade-Meng Tan , co-chair of a Nobel Peace Prize-nominated campaign and New York Times best-selling author, on Quora : Emotional Intelligence (EI) is defined as the ability to monitor one's own and others' feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them, and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions. Essentially, EI is a collection of mental and emotional skills. Therefore, to train EI, all you have to do is to train your mind to acquire those skills. In Search Inside Yourself , we do that in three steps: Step 1: Attention training. Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities. Specifically, the idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time. That quality of mind forms the foundation for emotional intelligence. Step 2: Self-knowledge and self-mastery. Use your sharpened attention to create high-resolution perception into your own cognitive and emotive processes. With that, you become able to observe your thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity, and to do so objectively from a third-person perspective. Once you can do that, you create the type of deep self-knowledge that eventually enables self-mastery. Step 3: Creating pro-social mental habits. Qualities such as kindness and compassion can be created as mental habits. For example, imagine whenever you meet anybody, your habitual, instinctive first thought is, ""I wish for this person to be happy."" This is the mental habit of kindness and is highly trainable the same way you train other mental habits. There are very many benefits to EI. Just in the business world, for example, emotional intelligence has at least three compelling benefits. First, it is highly correlated with stellar work performance. Studies show emotional competencies to be twice as important as cognitive competencies for doing outstanding work, even among engineers. Second, emotionally intelligent leaders and managers are far more effective than leaders or managers low on emotional intelligence. Finally, emotional intelligence creates the conditions for personal happiness, and happy workers are a great asset because they work better in teams, provide better service to customers (and happy customers return to spend more money), and are generally more creative and productive. There are also compelling personal benefits, and the most basic of those occur in three categories: calmness and clarity of mind, resilience, and more satisfying relationships. First, you become increasingly skillful at calming the body and mind and seeing things clearly and objectively, even in difficult situations. There are studies that show just a few weeks of mindfulness training can reduce the activity of the part of the brain associated with fear and panic, called the amygdala. There is also a fascinating 2014 study that shows that with merely 15 minutes of mindfulness meditation, you can begin to overcome cognitive bias in decision making. Second, as you become increasingly skillful at calmness and clarity, you also become increasingly resilient in the face of life's difficulties. Like a kung fu fighter who can defeat more powerful opponents as she becomes more skillful at martial arts, in the same way, you can manage life's problems with increasing ease and joy as your practice gets deeper. Third, you begin to see yourself with increasing kindness, and you begin to see everyone with increasing kindness, and because of that, relationships become more satisfying. With kindness, happy relationships become happier, neutral relationships become happy, and unhappy relationships become manageable. This question originally appeared on Quora --the knowledge-sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights. You can follow Quora on Twitter , Facebook , and Google+ . More questions:","If you like the tips and ideas I share here (and I sure hope you do), I've got some good news for you. I'm changing what has forever been the ""Mountain Goat Software Monthly Newsletter"" to be just quite simply weekly tips from me. Face it: Mountain Goat Software isn't exactly awash with ""news"" so when it came time to write a ""monthly newsletter,"" I never quite knew what to put in there. So, I would write something that was exactly the same as a blog post. And because newsletter content was about the same as blog content, we'd re-publish the newsletter on the blog. Sure, we'd put a little news in the newsletter, but it was mostly sales stuff like a list of classes or cities I was teaching in. You probably didn't want that. So, there's more good news: we're taking the list of courses out of what will now be a weekly tip. You know I teach classes. You know how to figure out where I teach them. Oh sure, the old newsletter occasionally contained news such as I would be speaking at a conference, or that I was working on a new book or video course. And the weekly tips email will still be the first place to read that type of news. So, if you're interested in tips on how to succeed with agile, sign up now . You'll get a new tip from me each Thursday. And this will be your only way to get those tips. I'm saving my best tips for these emails. Tips will not be reposted on the blog as in the past. And, of course, I promise we won't spam you or give your info to anyone else."

Attach a screenshot ifpossible.",The spec bug is:https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=24288,"We should add a --render-process-limit=N command line flag to allow users to specify a different limit than the one computed in render_process_host_impl.cc. This would be useful for testers and to diagnose bugs, both to intentionally hit the limit or avoid it.Using the flag could perhaps output a warning if the user specifies a value higher than a known threshold, such as the Windows and Mac limits mentioned on issue 104689.","Currently we have chrome_update_manifest running on vm1-m2; running an old snapshot of chromite; manual deployment/setup basically, outside of the normal infrastructure setup.This is problematic since 1) it's not integrated into our deployment (thus if the host dies, even on re-deploy this syncing/updating is still out), 2) the code no longer is getting any fixes (hell, it was removed from ToT since it sat broke for 2 months), 3) my annoyance- it now is actively blocking converting minilayout into manifest groups of full.xml.Aware that there is talk of dropping the gerrit source workflow, but filing this issue since that talks been there for ~2 months and doesn't seem to be moving particularly quickly.Thus time to track this issue. I'll cut a patch hacking around #3, but the base issue needs sorting.","We need to provide feedback report sending mechanism for 3rd party kiosk apps to send us feedback report.There are two immediate options:a) expose feedbackPrivate.API, andb) provide top level UI that will initiate feedback report post(a) requires webapp changes, so the quickest way to do this on Chrome side is really (b).So, we should:1. Provide mechanism to start kiosk app in special ""diagnostics"" mode. I suggest ctrl+click from login screen (after ctrl+alt+S escape hatch is pressed).2. Once the kiosk app launched, and we are in ""diagnostic"" mode, schedule delayed task that will kick off feedback report to be sent to us. Make sure that app_id is included in the content of the feedback report."

We always head here after nursing the usual high cost city hangover - but don't worry at Ballans you will never feel ripped off ! 3 types of eggs to choose from all cooked to perfection with a lovely sausage , toast , beans and small pieces of hash browns take a beer on the side and enjoy your trip to balans don't even look another way in the Westfield this is THE place to go !!!! Come on","Average pub, where you can be serve quickly. Th only down side will be the crowd around the some of the staff. You do't fell very welcome there","Personally my favourite Pakistani restaurant in tooting. Good food, good meat quality and a reasonable price.","For a while now I√É¬å√Ç¬¢√É¬•√É¬õ√É¬•√Ç¬™ve been dreaming of that Burger to die for, few places do the Burger that makes you think, should I or shouldn√É¬å√Ç¬¢√É¬•√É¬õ√É¬•√Ç¬™t I, as it looks so bad but tastes so damn good. Well GBK has this tied down to a Tee, they make Burgers that not only tastes great but look amazing. To have your Burger cooked to medium is perfect for me. I had the Avocado Bacon Burger whilst my Beautiful Daughter had the Cheese and Bacon, take your pick as you√É¬å√Ç¬¢√É¬•√É¬õ√É¬•√Ç¬™ll be satisfied with any on the menu. The staff were also very helpful in the Ealing branch. A must try.","It's close to Regent Street and its tucked away in one of the back streets. Nice quaint restaurant that serves good, delectable japanese cuisine. It is definitely one of the better japanese restaurants in the area for sure."

Place asparagus on foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt. With your hands  roll the asparagus around until they are evenly coated with oil and salt. Roast for 10-15 minutes  depending on the thickness of your stalks and how tender you like them. They should be tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. The tips of the spears will get very brown but watch them to prevent burning. They are great plain  but sometimes I serve them with a light vinaigrette if we need something acidic to balance out our meal. ",Add hot water to yeast in a large bowl and let sit for 15 minutes.

2277,Statistical concept and methodology,3,3,0,0,2,66.66666667,0,0,0,0,"Poverty estimates at national poverty lines are computed from household survey data collected from nationally representative samples of households. These data must contain sufficiently detailed information to compute a comprehensive estimate of total household income or consumption (including consumption or income from own production), from which it is possible to construct a correctly weighted distribution of per capita consumption or income.

National poverty lines are the benchmark for estimating poverty indicators that are consistent with the country's specific economic and social circumstances. National poverty lines reflect local perceptions of the level and composition of consumption or income needed to be non-poor. The perceived boundary between poor and non-poor typically rises with the average income of a country and thus does not provide a uniform measure for comparing poverty rates across countries. While poverty rates at national poverty lines should not be used for comparing poverty rates across countries, they are appropriate for guiding and monitoring the results of country-specific national poverty reduction strategies.

Almost all national poverty lines are anchored to the cost of a food bundle - based on the prevailing national diet of the poor - that provides adequate nutrition for good health and normal activity, plus an allowance for nonfood spending. National poverty lines must be adjusted for inflation between survey years to remain constant in real terms and thus allow for meaningful comparisons of poverty over time. Because diets and consumption baskets change over time, countries periodically recalculate the poverty line based on new survey data. In such cases the new poverty lines should be deflated to obtain comparable poverty estimates from earlier years. The data is based on the two most recent years for which survey data are available.

Survey year is the year in which the underlying household survey data were collected or, when the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the year in which most of the data were collected.","Separate national poverty lines are often constructed for the rural and urban areas of a country.

2509,Description of incident,3,65,0,0,65,100,0,0,0,0,"A band of brazen thieves ripped 
          off hundreds of New Yorkers by rigging ATMs to steal account and password 
          information from bank customers. The first - a skimmer - went over the 
          slot where customers insert their ATM cards. The skimmer read, and 
          stored, the personal information kept in the magnetic strip on the back 
          of the bank card. The second device was a tiny camera hidden in the lighted 
          signs over the ATM. The pinhole camera lens pointed directly onto the 
          ATM keypad and filmed victims typing in their supposedly secret PIN 
          codes. The thieves would then create their own phony ATM cards and use 
          their victims' PINs to access accounts.","Companies Lexis Nexis and Investigative 
          Professionals have notified up to 40,000 individuals whose sensitive 
          and personally identifiable information may have been viewed 
          by individuals who did not have legitimate access. The data breach is linked 
          to a Nigerian scam artist who used the information to incur fraudulent 
          charges on victims' credit cards. Of the 40,000 individuals whose 
          information was accessed, up to 300 were compromised and used to obtain 
          fraudulent credit cards. The private information viewed included names, 
          dates of birth and possibly Social Security numbers.","An ATM and credit card reader              in a checkout aisle at the Los Gatos Lunardi's supermarket was recently              switched, resulting in cases of identity theft. Victims all had their              card numbers stolen after officials from Lunardi's contacted them              about a problem with one of their card readers.UPDATE             (8/4/08): Police arrested a man Friday that was involved with the              ATM scam at a Los Gatos supermarket that lost about $300,000. He was              booked into the Santa Clara County Jail in connection with burglary,              conspiracy, drunken driving, and further charges may be filed later,              according to the district attorney's office.","Redbox rents DVD movies via vending 
            machine in drugstores and supermarkets throughout the country. They 
            announced that they'd found credit card skimmers attached to three 
            of their kiosks.","Bank Atlantic confirms they had 
            a data loss, involving their MasterCard debit cards. It happened through 
            a local merchant, but at this time, isn't saying which one."

Republican Bill Brief for: House Sub. SB42 

Date Passed Committee: 03/13/17 

 
 Bill Brief Author:  Rep. Jennings 
  
Sponsored by:  House Corrections & Juvenile Justice Committee 
 
A Bill Concerning:   Juvenile Offenders â Trailer Bill to 2016 SB 367 
 
What Bill Does:   This legislation makes changes to the juvenile offender code as revised in the 2016 session of 
the legislature through passage of SB 367. The original bill, HB 2466, contained one provision that altered the 
possible penalties for the use of a firearm during the commission of an offense by a juvenile.  HB 2466 bill was 
amended in committee and the contents of the amended bill were inserted into SB42.  The bill does the 
following: 
 

1.   Establishes a special sentencing rule for offenses where the juvenile uses a firearm in the commission of 
the offense.  The special sentencing rule will provide that upon a finding of the trier of fact that a firearm 
was used by the offender, the offender may be committed to a juvenile correctional facility for a 
minimum term of six months and a maximum term of 18 months regardless of whether the underlying 
offense committed would be an offense for which commitment to a correctional facility would otherwise 
be available. 

2.  Requires the Department of Corrections to establish and maintain a statewide searchable database that 

contains information regarding juvenile participation in immediate intervention programs.  Access to the 
database will be required to include county and district attorneys, judges, community supervision 
officers and juvenile intake and assessment officers.  

3.  Provides that when a juvenile offender absconds from supervision the act of absconding does not 

constitute a âtechnical violationâ of the conditions of supervision and upon reasonable efforts to locate 
the juvenile a warrant may be issued by the court. Current law requires three technical violations of 
supervision before revocation can occur.  Probation term limits and overall case length limits shall be 
tolled during the period that the offender absconded. 

4.  Defines the point in time in the proceeding of a juvenile offender case upon which the counting of days 

towards the imposed detention limitation of 45 days is calculated.  The count of detention days will 
commence upon disposition (sentencing) or 15 days following adjudication, whichever is sooner. 

5.  Changes the current limitation of 3 months to the total case time limit when removal of the offender 

from the home is necessary because the victim of a sex offense normally resides in the same residence as 
the offender. 

6.  Renames the juvenile justice improvement fund to the evidence-based program account of the state 
general fund and provides the Secretary of Corrections the ability to transfer funds projected to be 
available as a result of savings generated by juvenile justice reform when identified rather than the 
current method of annual transfer at the conclusion of the fiscal year.  Funds deposited in the evidence-
based program account remain out of reach for allotment by the Governor and are limited in their use for 
community programs and no other governmental purpose. 

7.  Incorporates identical language as found in the Code for Care of Children regarding specific findings 

with respect to reasonable efforts having been taken to avoid the out of home placement.  These findings 
are required to be made by the court upon an initial out of home placement in order to assure eligibility 
for federal IV -E support for juvenile offenders when placed out of home.  These findings in no way 

modify the findings required to be made by the court with respect to the initial order of out of home 
placement and only serve to supplement those findings in order to protect the interest of the state in 
assuring the highest level of federal funding available. 

8.  A technical change to eliminate duplicative language regarding required family reintegration efforts of 
the Department of Children and Family Services when a Child in Need of Care proceeding is ongoing 
during the term of a juvenile offender proceeding or dispositional case length limit period. 

9.  Changes the number, membership and role of the Kansas Juvenile Justice Oversight Committee.  The 

number of members is increased from 19 to 21.  The two additional members include one member 
appointed by the Chair of the Kansas Advisory Group (KAG) on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention from the youth membership of the KAG. The second additional member is a detention center 
director appointed by the Attorney General. The duties of the committee are expanded to include 
creating a plan to address the mental health needs of youth in the juvenile justice system and review the 
collaborative work of the Department of Corrections and the Office of Judicial Administration and make 
recommendations when there is not consensus between the two.  

10. Includes certain modifications to the law pertaining to Immediate Intervention Programs (IIP) (formerly 

known as diversion agreements) 

a.  Provides that permitting participation in an IIP for a misdemeanor sex offense is within the 

discretion of the prosecutor and not automatically available to the offender. 

b.  In the case of a juvenile who is originally charged with a felony offense and a plea agreement is 

reached for a plea to a misdemeanor, the offender is not automatically entitled to an IIP if the 
offense constitutes a first-time misdemeanor offense.  Participation in an IIP would be within the 
discretion of the prosecutor. 

c.  The prosecutor may exclude an offender from mandatory participation in an IIP when the 

prosecutor declines prosecution. 

d.  Mandatory availability of an IIP for a misdemeanor offense will apply only to the first event of a 

misdemeanor violation.  Second or subsequent instances of misdemeanor violations, when the 
offender has previously participated in an IIP, the prosecutor will have discretion to permit 
additional instances of participation in an IIP.  

11.  Amends the placement matrix statute (version effective July 1, 2017) to consolidate the categories of 

serious offender III and serious offender IV, which carry the same risk-level requirements and JCF 
commitment terms, into a single serious offender III category. 

 
Political Reality/Implications:   Affords prosecutors and judges greater discretion in certain circumstances, 
holds youth accountable for their behavior in ways appropriate to their developmental stage and enhances 
public safety through providing evidence-based interventions within the community that change behavior of 
offending youth. 
 
Committee Amendments:   Yes 
 
Possible Floor Amendments:  Yes - but none known now.

*Note:  The process method used to construct the bill was not particularly conducive for conferees to indicate 
status as a proponent, opponent or neutral.  All presenting are being reported as a conferee. A brief summary of 
their position is provided.  Their full written testimony is available on the legislative website under the 
Correction and Juvenile Justice Committee minutes tab.  
 
Fiscal Note:   No fiscal implications outside of agency existing resources.  Incremental expense in an unknown 
amount may be incurred because of the IIP database requirement.  However, it is contemplated this component 
of data may be added to an existing information management system program without significant expense.  
Some lost savings as a result of expanding the offenses in which a firearm is used to allow for juvenile 
correctional facility commitment may occur. 
 
Who will carry the bill:   Rep. Jennings 
 
Is this bill ready to run on the floor?  Yes

To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt ten years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be
All alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this

Who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers cause my name's a reminder
Of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up
And you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be

All that I'm asking for is forgiveness
Are you even listening? Am I talking to myself again?
I keep on staring up at the ceiling
Waiting for you to give me some kind of reason
Are you even listening? Am I talking to myself again?
And I know you don't owe me your love
And I know that you don't owe me nothing at all
Ain't no way I'm giving up on you
Don't leave me here in the dark when it's hard to see
Show me your heart, shed a light on me
If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so
You know I can't live without you, I'm on my knees
Where are you now? Shed a light on me
If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so

I'll try to talk, you keep on dancing
I can feel you on my skin, but am I only dancing with the wind?

And I know that you don't owe me nothing at all
Ain't no way I'm giving up on you
Don't leave me here in the dark when it's hard to see
Show me your heart, shed a light on me

","Yo conozco su cara y conozco su alma
Que no hay gente mÃ¡s buena que yo haya visto en otro lugar
Es mi pueblo, es mi herencia
Que me dio mi bandera
Que se alegra la vida cuando un domingo sale a pasear
No se queda en su cama
Se le nota en las ganas
Y aunque no ha amanecido muy tempranito sale a entrenar
Es un noble guerrero, un halcÃ³n montaÃ±ero
Que sube ligero y en las montaÃ±as se ve reinar
Se lo digo yo, que me lleva el llanto
Esa es la emociÃ³n de ser colombiano
Gracias mi tierra querida te doy las gracias
Caramba mi chino y toda la patria
Caramba mi chino y toda la patria
AhÃ­ va mi chino parado en su bicicleta
Caramba mi chino cruzÃ³ la meta
Caramba mi chino cruzÃ³ la meta
Yo conozco esa cara y conozco su alma

Gracias mi tierra querida te doy las gracias
Caramba mi chino y toda la patria
Caramba mi chino y toda la patria
AhÃ­ va mi chino parado en su bicicleta
Caramba mi chino cruzÃ³ la meta
Caramba mi chino cruzÃ³ la meta
Rodando EfraÃ­n El Zipa Forero

Patrocinio y Oliverio
Y el pajarito volando
Condorito con Libardo
Lucho Herrera, Fabio Parra
Soler, NiÃ±o y Rigoberto

Y hasta tumba rodo el Clavito
Maria Luisa y La Gran Mariana
Sergio Luis, Pantano y Gaviria

Se lo digo yo, que me lleva el llanto
Esa es la emociÃ³n de ser colombiano
Gracias mi tierra querida te doy las gracias

3855,Text,3,351,0,0,317,90.31339031,0,0,0,0,"Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I'm Lester Holt, anchor of ""NBC Nightly News."" I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate. The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns. The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion. The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying. I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.",(APPLAUSE),"How are you, Donald?",Good luck to you.,"Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people. Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let's begin. We're calling this opening segment ""Achieving Prosperity."" And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?"
